"0" is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). "+" is a thoughtful analysis (A). </h2><h2>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING </strong> consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic. &nbsp; Students will be responsible for leading discussion twice. </h2><h2><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY </strong>: </h2><h2>Attendance is expected. &nbsp; Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. &nbsp; Turn off your cell phones! </h2><h2><strong>GRADE DISTRIBUTION </strong>: </h2><h2>Participation/Web = 30% </h2><h2>Reaction Papers = 30% </h2><h2>Discussion Leading (First time) = 15% </h2><h2>Discussion Leading (Second time) = 15% </h2><h2>Additional 10% </h2><h2 ALIGN=left><br></h2></BODY></HTML>
