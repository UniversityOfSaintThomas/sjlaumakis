<P><B>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</B></P>

<H3>As an introduction to ethics, the course will focus on the historical
and philosophical origins of human reflections on the ultimate end and meaning
of human life as well as on the morality of human acts. It will also trace
the development of philosophical reflection on moral custom by highlighting
the fundamental ideas in the thought of several important philosophers.
Finally, we will examine in some detail the practical consequences of a
specific ethical view.</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to ethics by presenting the
questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the
morality of human actions. It is expected by the end of the semester that
you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able
to articulate coherently your own understanding of the good/best life for
human beings.</H3>
