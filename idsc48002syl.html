Both Confucianism and Taoism are indigenous to China whileBuddhism was imported from India.  This course will explore each of thesethree traditions as well as their interactions and influences on major periodsof Chinese history.  It will also consider the similarities and differencesbetween &quot;Chinese&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; conceptions of philosophy. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know the essential featuresof each tradition and be able to articulate the strengths and weaknessesof each view.</P><P>The course will be divided into three parts.  It will begin with an overviewof the background, origin, and spirit of Chinese philosophy.  About threeweeks each will be devoted to the three &quot;schools&quot; of thought. Each of these segments will briefly discuss the history, major works andauthors, and key ideas of the philosophical tradition.  Questions to beconsidered include:  What are the essential features of each tradition?How are their perspectives related?  Distinct?  Are they consistent? Contradictory? Are all three perspectives necessary for a complete understanding of Chinesethought, or does one provide a more complete or satisfactory account?  Howare the three &quot;Chinese&quot; perspectives different from &quot;Western&quot;views of reality?  Which view(s)(if any) seems better and why?</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>REQUIRED TEXTS:</P><P>Confucius, THE ANALECTS</P><P>Lao Tzu, TAO TE CHING</P><P>Fung Yu-Lan, A SHORT HISTORY OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY</P><P>SELECTED HANDOUTS</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>ASSIGNMENTS:</P><P>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you tothe subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, posedistressing questions, and just plain make you think.  Students will beassigned weekly reading from each tradition.  They will be asked to participatein an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one page reactionpaper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion andto presentations about the readings.  Students will be evaluated based ongeneral class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers,in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a final paper.</P><P>The course will begin with a lecture format--for two weeks only.  Itwill then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on studentparticipation.  Students will be responsible for four areas of activity:1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion Leading, and4) a Final Paper.</P><P>1) <B>PARTICIPATION</B> includes class discussion of the assigned readingsand/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar. Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each week.</P><P>2) <B>WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS</B> are 1 TYPED PAGE in length and are basedon the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion Areapostings for the week.  Students responsible for Discussion Leading in classwill be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during that week.  They will,however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</P><P>3) <B>DISCUSSION LEADING</B> consists of selecting a topic (by WEEK #2),meeting with Dr. Laumakis to discuss the reading (at least one week beforeyour topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussionon the Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion duringthe week you present the issues involved in your selection.</P><P>4) <B>THE FINAL PROJECT/PAPER</B> consists of either a synthesis of yourWeekly Reaction Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treatedin them or an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topicor theme treated in the seminar.  Late papers will be penalized one fullgrade for each day they are late.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</P><P>Attendance is expected.  Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>GRADE DISTRIBUTION:</P><P>Participation=      Weekly Papers =      Discussion Leading=      FinalProject=<BR></BODY></HTML>
