One day he sets sail on a long voyage.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">Things are going to get confusing quickly, so to help keep things clearlet's call the original ship that Theseus starts his voyage with &quot;ShipA&quot;.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">Ship A = Theseus' original ship.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">During this voyage, the ship needs various repairs. Theseus anticipatedthis and he brought with him a complete supply of new parts to make repairson his voyage. As repairs are needed, Theseus throws the old parts overboardand replaces them with new parts.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">The voyage is very long and eventually Theseus completely rebuilds theship. That is, he eventually replaces every part of the ship with new parts.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">He returns home to Greece (or wherever it was) after defeating the Minotaur(or whatever he did) in this completely new ship. Let's call this ship,&quot;Ship B&quot;.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">Ship B = The ship Theseus returns in.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">We already have the elements for the basic puzzle. The question is:</H3><H3 class="style1">Does Ship A = Ship B?</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">But to give the puzzle some more bite, consider the following additionaldetails to the story. Let's suppose that Theseus is followed on his voyageby another ship. The captain of this ship collects all of the old partsthat Theseus throws overboard. As we said, Theseus eventually throws everypart of his original ship overboard, so the captain of the following shipeventually collects every part of the original ship. Then this captain returnsto Greece and takes the collected parts to make a ship which is exactlylike Theseus' original ship (exactly like it, not just in that it's a faithfulreplica, it even has all the same parts, put together in the same way asShipA). </H3><H3 class="style1">Let's call this rebuilt ship, &quot;Ship C&quot;.</H3><H3 class="style1">Ship C = The ship that is built from the original parts that Theseusthrew overboard.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">The question is:</H3><H3 class="style1">Which of these ships is identical to the original ship?</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">It looks like there are four possible answers:</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">* Ship A = Ship B (and not C)</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">* Ship A = Ship C (and not B)</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">* Ship A = Both Ship B and C.</H3><H3 class="style1">&nbsp;</H3><H3 class="style1">* Ship A = Neither Ship B or C<BR></H3></BODY></HTML>
