<h1 align="center">TRADITIONAL AFRICAN  VIEW  OF THE HUMAN PERSON</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>1. <strong><u>First</u></strong>--be sure to read the article--it is on-line at my web site (under African Reading link) and at the Blackboard site for the course--under Course Documents.</h2>
<h2>2. If you can explain the diagram at the end--on page 170--then you will have a basic understanding of the article.</h2>
<h2>3. <strong><u>SLIDE #1</u></strong>--African View--HB vs. HP; Person &amp; Community; Individual &amp; Group</h2>
<h2>4. We need to distinguish Traditional Indigenous African Thought from African Philosophy that is influenced by Western Colonial philosophy</h2>
<h2>5. The article is concerned with comparing and contrasting the Traditional African conception of the Person with other &ldquo;Western&rdquo; conceptions of the Person</h2>
<h2>6. Western conceptions tend to focus on an abstracted feature of the individual as their defining characteristic (i.e., a soul, memory, rationality, or will)</h2>
<h2>7. And this Western way of thinking is captured in Rene DesCartes&rsquo; famous argument:</h2>
<h2>P1--If I think, then I am<br>
  <u>P2--I think</u><br>
  C--I am </h2>
<h2><br>
  8. Traditional African thinking denies this move and focuses on the environing community.</h2>
<h2>9. The argument for this view is captured in the quotation from John Mbiti:</h2>
<h2>P1--If we are, then I am<br>
  <u>P2--We are</u><br>
C--I am</h2>
<h2>10. Notice that the conclusion of each argument is the same--but the reasons offered in support of each conclusion are different!<br>
  </h2>
<h2>11. According to Traditional African Philosophy, the COMMUNITY comes before the INDIVIDUAL--it is both metaphysically prior to it and the individual depends on the community in order to exist and receive its PERSONHOOD from the community.</h2>
<h2>12. The Smallest community--2 people--is what is biologically required for a Human Being to come into existence--but HUMAN BEING (a biological entity) is NOT a HUMAN PERSON (a communally recognized entity)</h2>
<h2>13. Other Communal facts: language is community property; the gene pool from which we come is communal; even our navel points to the fact that we depend on others in order to exist; and we end up playing social roles that are defined (at least in part) by the community into which we are born and recognized</h2>
<h2>14. So the focus is on the process nature of becoming HP through rites of initiation and acceptance and recognition by the community</h2>
<h2>15. A HUMAN BEING (HB) is a biological organism vs. A HUMAN PERSON (HP) which results from a social and ritual transformation</h2>
<h2>16. So, one basic question to ask your self is: Is being a human person like hot/warm/cold water which admits of degrees or is it like being alive or being dead or being pregnant--which do not admit of degrees?</h2>
<h2>17. The evidence for the Traditional African view includes: 1. Our tendency to use &ldquo;it&rdquo; for new borns; 2. Little or no grief over the death of a child vs. the death of an elder (Traditional African Proverb: An old person dying is like a library burning.); 3. the rites of initiation that help one be incorporated into and recognized by the community; 4. Personhood is connected with moral function and playing a role within the community; 5. Persons are due justice (John Rawls agrees)</h2>
<h2>18. The author also compares the Traditional African view with Western Existentialism in five areas--find them in the reading!</h2>
<h2>19. So, Traditional African view agrees with Existentialism about the dynamic view of the person--as constantly changing and lacking a fixed essence</h2>
<h2>20. But there are some basic differences between them as well</h2>
<h2><br>
  21. Near the end of the article the author distinguishes three senses of human groupings: 1. Collectivities; 2. Constituted Groups; and 3. Random Collections. Which one is closest to the Traditional African understanding of the tribe?</h2>
<h2>22. And, more generally, what is the basic thing? The whole/team? Or the individual? Which has priority in being? Which is prior logically?</h2>
<h2>23. Is the TEAM more important than the individuals who make it up? &ldquo;More important&rdquo; in what sense--group survival? If yes, why? IF no, why?</h2>
<h2>24. How are we to understand the diagram at the end of the reading? </h2>
