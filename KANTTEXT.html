<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>INTRODUCTORY ETHICS</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>KANT'S FOUNDATIONS OF THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><HR></H2>

<H3>There is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely, this: Act</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>should become a universal law.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Now if all imperatives of duty can be deduced from this one</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>imperative as from their principle, then, although it should remain</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>undecided what is called duty is not merely a vain notion, yet at</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>least we shall be able to show what we understand by it and what</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>this notion means.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Since the universality of the law according to which effects are</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>produced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>general sense (as to form), that is the existence of things so far</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>as it is determined by general laws, the imperative of duty may be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>expressed thus: Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>thy will a universal law of nature.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>We will now enumerate a few duties, adopting the usual division of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>them into duties to ourselves and ourselves and to others, and into</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>perfect and imperfect duties.*</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>*It must be noted here that I reserve the division of duties for a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>future metaphysic of morals; so that I give it here only as an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>arbitrary one (in order to arrange my examples). For the rest, I</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>understand by a perfect duty one that admits no exception in favour
of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>inclination and then I have not merely external but also internal</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>perfect duties. This is contrary to the use of the word adopted in the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>schools; but I do not intend to justify there, as it is all one for
my</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>purpose whether it is admitted or not.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>1. A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself
to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>take his own life. Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>could become a universal law of nature. His maxim is: &quot;From</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>self-love I adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>duration is likely to bring more evil than satisfaction.&quot; It is</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>asked then simply whether this principle founded on self-love can</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>become a universal law of nature. Now we see at once that a system</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of nature of which it should be a law to destroy life by means of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>improvement of life would contradict itself and, therefore, could</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not exist as a system of nature; hence that maxim cannot possibly</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>exist as a universal law of nature and, consequently, would be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>wholly inconsistent with the supreme principle of all duty.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>definite time. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>much conscience as to ask himself: &quot;Is it not unlawful and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way?&quot;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the maxim of his</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>action would be expressed thus: &quot;When I think myself in want of
money,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>never can do so.&quot; Now this principle of self-love or of one's own</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>but the question now is, &quot;Is it right?&quot; I change then the
suggestion</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of self-love into a universal law, and state the question thus: &quot;How</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>would it be if my maxim were a universal law?&quot; Then I see at once
that</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>it could never hold as a universal law of nature, but would</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be a universal</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>statements as vain pretences.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>3. A third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>culture might make him a useful man in many respects. But he finds</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>pleasure rather than to take pains in enlarging and improving his</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>happy natural capacities. He asks, however, whether his maxim of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>neglect of his natural gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination
to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>indulgence, agrees also with what is called duty. He sees then that</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>a system of nature could indeed subsist with such a universal law</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>although men (like the South Sea islanders) should let their talents</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>rest and resolve to devote their lives merely to idleness,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>enjoyment; but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law of nature, or be implanted in us as such by a natural instinct.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>For, as a rational being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>developed, since they serve him and have been given him, for all sorts</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of possible purposes.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>4. A fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others have to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contend with great wretchedness and that he could help them, thinks:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&quot;What concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy as Heaven</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>pleases, or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>even envy him, only I do not wish to contribute anything to his</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>welfare or to his assistance in distress!&quot; Now no doubt if such
a mode</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of thinking were a universal law, the human race might very well</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>subsist and doubtless even better than in a state in which everyone</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes care occasionally to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>put it into practice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>betrays the rights of men, or otherwise violates them. But although
it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>with that maxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>have the universal validity of a law of nature. For a will which</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>occur in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>and in which, by such a law of nature, sprung from his own will, he</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>These are a few of the many actual duties, or at least what we</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>regard as such, which obviously fall into two classes on the one</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>principle that we have laid down. We must be able to will that a maxim</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of our action should be a universal law. This is the canon of the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>moral appreciation of the action generally. Some actions are of such
a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>character that their maxim cannot without contradiction be even</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>conceived as a universal law of nature, far from it being possible</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that we should will that it should be so. In others this intrinsic</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>impossibility is not found, but still it is impossible to will that</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>since such a will would contradict itself It is easily seen that the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>former violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) duty; the latter only</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>laxer (meritorious) duty. Thus it has been completely shown how all</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>duties depend as regards the nature of the obligation (not the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>object of the action) on the same principle.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>If now we attend to ourselves on occasion of any transgression of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>should be a universal law, for that is impossible for us; on the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contrary, we will that the opposite should remain a universal law,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>only we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favour
or</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>(just for this time only) in favour of our inclination. Consequently</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>namely, that of reason, we should find a contradiction in our own</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>will, namely, that a certain principle should be objectively necessary</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>as a universal law, and yet subjectively should not be universal,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>but admit of exceptions. As however we at one moment regard our action</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to reason, and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>affected by inclination, there is not really any contradiction, but
an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason, whereby the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality, so</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that the practical principle of reason shall meet the maxim half</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>way. Now, although this cannot be justified in our own impartial</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>judgement, yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the categorical imperative and (with all respect for it) only allow</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ourselves a few exceptions, which we think unimportant and forced from</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>us.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>We have thus established at least this much, that if duty is a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>conception which is to have any import and real legislative</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>authority for our actions, it can only be expressed in categorical and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not at all in hypothetical imperatives. We have also, which is of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>great importance, exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>application the content of the categorical imperative, which must</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contain the principle of all duty if there is such a thing at all.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>We have not yet, however, advanced so far as to prove a priori that</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>there actually is such an imperative, that there is a practical law</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>which commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse, and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that the following of this law is duty.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>With the view of attaining to this, it is of extreme importance to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>remember that we must not allow ourselves to think of deducing the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reality of this principle from the particular attributes of human</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>nature. For duty is to be a practical, unconditional necessity of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>action; it must therefore hold for all rational beings (to whom an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>imperative can apply at all), and for this reason only be also a law</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>for all human wills. On the contrary, whatever is deduced from the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>particular natural characteristics of humanity, from certain</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>feelings and propensions, nay, even, if possible, from any</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>particular tendency proper to human reason, and which need not</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>necessarily hold for the will of every rational being; this may indeed</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>supply us with a maxim, but not with a law; with a subjective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>principle on which we may have a propension and inclination to act,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>but not with an objective principle on which we should be enjoined</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>to act, even though all our propensions, inclinations, and natural</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>dispositions were opposed to it. In fact, the sublimity and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>intrinsic dignity of the command in duty are so much the more evident,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the less the subjective impulses favour it and the more they oppose</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>it, without being able in the slightest degree to weaken the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>obligation of the law or to diminish its validity.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Here then we see philosophy brought to a critical position, since it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>has to be firmly fixed, notwithstanding that it has nothing to support</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>it in heaven or earth. Here it must show its purity as absolute</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>director of its own laws, not the herald of those which are</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>whispered to it by an implanted sense or who knows what tutelary</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>nature. Although these may be better than nothing, yet they can</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>never afford principles dictated by reason, which must have their</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>source wholly a priori and thence their commanding authority,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>expecting everything from the supremacy of the law and the due respect</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>for it, nothing from inclination, or else condemning the man to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>self-contempt and inward abhorrence.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Thus every empirical element is not only quite incapable of being an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>aid to the principle of morality, but is even highly prejudicial to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the purity of morals, for the proper and inestimable worth of an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>absolutely good will consists just in this, that the principle of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>action is free from all influence of contingent grounds, which alone</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>experience can furnish. We cannot too much or too often repeat our</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>warning against this lax and even mean habit of thought which seeks</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>for its principle amongst empirical motives and laws; for human reason</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow, and in a dream of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>sweet illusions (in which, instead of Juno, it embraces a cloud) it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>derivation, which looks like anything one chooses to see in it, only</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not like virtue to one who has once beheld her in her true form.*</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>*To behold virtue in her proper form is nothing else but to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contemplate morality stripped of all admixture of sensible things</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>and of every spurious ornament of reward or self-love. How much she</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>then eclipses everything else that appears charming to the affections,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>every one may readily perceive with the least exertion of his</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reason, if it be not wholly spoiled for abstraction.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The question then is this: &quot;Is it a necessary law for all rational</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>beings that they should always judge of their actions by maxims of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>which they can themselves will that they should serve as universal</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>laws?&quot; If it is so, then it must be connected (altogether a priori)</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>with the very conception of the will of a rational being generally.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>But in order to discover this connexion we must, however</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reluctantly, take a step into metaphysic, although into a domain of
it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>which is distinct from speculative philosophy, namely, the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>metaphysic of morals. In a practical philosophy, where it is not the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reasons of what happens that we have to ascertain, but the laws of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>what ought to happen, even although it never does, i.e., objective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>practical laws, there it is not necessary to inquire into the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reasons why anything pleases or displeases, how the pleasure of mere</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>sensation differs from taste, and whether the latter is distinct</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>from a general satisfaction of reason; on what the feeling of pleasure</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>or pain rests, and how from it desires and inclinations arise, and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>from these again maxims by the co-operation of reason: for all this</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>belongs to an empirical psychology, which would constitute the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>second part of physics, if we regard physics as the philosophy of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>nature, so far as it is based on empirical laws. But here we are</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>concerned with objective practical laws and, consequently, with the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>relation of the will to itself so far as it is determined by reason</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>alone, in which case whatever has reference to anything empirical is</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>necessarily excluded; since if reason of itself alone determines the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>conduct (and it is the possibility of this that we are now</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>investigating), it must necessarily do so a priori.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>action in accordance with the conception of certain laws. And such a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>faculty can be found only in rational beings. Now that which serves</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the will as the objective ground of its self-determination is the end,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>and, if this is assigned by reason alone, it must hold for all</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>rational beings. On the other hand, that which merely contains the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ground of possibility of the action of which the effect is the end,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>this is called the means. The subjective ground of the desire is the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>spring, the objective ground of the volition is the motive; hence</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the distinction between subjective ends which rest on springs, and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>objective ends which depend on motives valid for every rational being.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Practical principles are formal when they abstract from all subjective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ends; they are material when they assume these, and therefore</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>particular springs of action. The ends which a rational being proposes</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>to himself at pleasure as effects of his actions (material ends) are</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>all only relative, for it is only their relation to the particular</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>desires of the subject that gives them their worth, which therefore</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>cannot furnish principles universal and necessary for all rational</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>beings and for every volition, that is to say practical laws. Hence</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>all these relative ends can give rise only to hypothetical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>imperatives.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Supposing, however, that there were something whose existence has in</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>itself an absolute worth, something which, being an end in itself,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>could be a source of definite laws; then in this and this alone</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>would lie the source of a possible categorical imperative, i.e., a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>practical law.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Now I say: man and generally any rational being exists as an end</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>in himself, not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that will, but in all his actions, whether they concern himself or</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>other rational beings, must be always regarded at the same time as</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>an end. All objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>for if the inclinations and the wants founded on them did not exist,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>then their object would be without value. But the inclinations,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>themselves being sources of want, are so far from having an absolute</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>worth for which they should be desired that on the contrary it must
be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the universal wish of every rational being to be wholly free from</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>them. Thus the worth of any object which is to be acquired by our</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>action is always conditional. Beings whose existence depends not on</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>our will but on nature's, have nevertheless, if they are irrational</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>beings, only a relative value as means, and are therefore called</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>things; rational beings, on the contrary, are called persons,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>because their very nature points them out as ends in themselves,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>that is as something which must not be used merely as means, and so</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>far therefore restricts freedom of action (and is an object of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>respect). These, therefore, are not merely subjective ends whose</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action, but objective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ends, that is, things whose existence is an end in itself; an end</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>moreover for which no other can be substituted, which they should</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>subserve merely as means, for otherwise nothing whatever would possess</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>absolute worth; but if all worth were conditioned and therefore</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contingent, then there would be no supreme practical principle of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reason whatever.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>If then there is a supreme practical principle or, in respect of the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>human will, a categorical imperative, it must be one which, being</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>everyone because it is an end in itself, constitutes an objective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>principle of will, and can therefore serve as a universal practical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law. The foundation of this principle is: rational nature exists as
an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>end in itself. Man necessarily conceives his own existence as being</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>so; so far then this is a subjective principle of human actions. But</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>every other rational being regards its existence similarly, just on</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the same rational principle that holds for me:* so that it is at the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>same time an objective principle, from which as a supreme practical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced. Accordingly</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the practical imperative will be as follows: So act as to treat</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>every case as an end withal, never as means only. We will now</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>inquire whether this can be practically carried out.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>*This proposition is here stated as a postulate. The ground of it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>will be found in the concluding section.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>To abide by the previous examples:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Firstly, under the head of necessary duty to oneself: He who</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself. If he</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>destroys himself in order to escape from painful circumstances, he</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>uses a person merely as a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up
to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the end of life. But a man is not a thing, that is to say, something</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>which can be used merely as means, but must in all his actions be</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>always considered as an end in himself. I cannot, therefore, dispose</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>in any way of a man in my own person so as to mutilate him, to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>damage or kill him. (It belongs to ethics proper to define this</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>principle more precisely, so as to avoid all misunderstanding, e.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>g., as to the amputation of the limbs in order to preserve myself,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>as to exposing my life to danger with a view to preserve it, etc. This</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>question is therefore omitted here.)</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Secondly, as regards necessary duties, or those of strict</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>obligation, towards others: He who is thinking of making a lying</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>promise to others will see at once that he would be using another</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>man merely as a mean, without the latter containing at the same time</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the end in himself. For he whom I propose by such a promise to use for</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>my own purposes cannot possibly assent to my mode of acting towards</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>him and, therefore, cannot himself contain the end of this action.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>This violation of the principle of humanity in other men is more</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>obvious if we take in examples of attacks on the freedom and</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>property of others. For then it is clear that he who transgresses</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>means, without considering that as rational beings they ought always</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>to be esteemed also as ends, that is, as beings who must be capable
of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>containing in themselves the end of the very same action.*</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>*Let it not be thought that the common &quot;quod tibi non vis fieri,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>etc.&quot; could serve here as the rule or principle. For it is only
a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>deduction from the former, though with several limitations; it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>cannot be a universal law, for it does not contain the principle of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>duties to oneself, nor of the duties of benevolence to others (for</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>many a one would gladly consent that others should not benefit him,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>them), nor finally that of duties of strict obligation to one another,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>for on this principle the criminal might argue against the judge who</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>punishes him, and so on.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Thirdly, as regards contingent (meritorious) duties to oneself: It</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>is not enough that the action does not violate humanity in our own</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>person as an end in itself, it must also harmonize with it. Now</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>there are in humanity capacities of greater perfection, which belong</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>to the end that nature has in view in regard to humanity in</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ourselves as the subject: to neglect these might perhaps be consistent</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>with the maintenance of humanity as an end in itself, but not with the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>advancement of this end.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Fourthly, as regards meritorious duties towards others: The</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>natural end which all men have is their own happiness. Now humanity</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>might indeed subsist, although no one should contribute anything to</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the happiness of others, provided he did not intentionally withdraw</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>anything from it; but after all this would only harmonize negatively</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not positively with humanity as an end in itself, if every one does</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not also endeavour, as far as in him lies, to forward the ends of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>others. For the ends of any subject which is an end in himself ought</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>as far as possible to be my ends also, if that conception is to have</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>its full effect with me.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>This principle, that humanity and generally every rational nature is</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>an end in itself (which is the supreme limiting condition of every</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>man's freedom of action), is not borrowed from experience, firstly,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>because it is universal, applying as it does to all rational beings</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>whatever, and experience is not capable of determining anything</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>about them; secondly, because it does not present humanity as an end</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>to men (subjectively), that is as an object which men do of themselves</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>actually adopt as an end; but as an objective end, which must as a law</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>constitute the supreme limiting condition of all our subjective</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ends, let them be what we will; it must therefore spring from pure</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>reason. In fact the objective principle of all practical legislation</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>lies (according to the first principle) in the rule and its form of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>universality which makes it capable of being a law (say, e. g., a</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law of nature); but the subjective principle is in the end; now by the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>second principle the subject of all ends is each rational being,</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>inasmuch as it is an end in itself. Hence follows the third</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>practical principle of the will, which is the ultimate condition of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>its harmony with universal practical reason, viz.: the idea of the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>will of every rational being as a universally legislative will.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>On this principle all maxims are rejected which are inconsistent</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>with the will being itself universal legislator. Thus the will is</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>not subject simply to the law, but so subject that it must be regarded</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>as itself giving the law and, on this ground only, subject to the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law (of which it can regard itself as the author).</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>In the previous imperatives, namely, that based on the conception of</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>the conformity of actions to general laws, as in a physical system</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of nature, and that based on the universal prerogative of rational</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>beings as ends in themselves- these imperatives, just because they</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>were conceived as categorical, excluded from any share in their</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>authority all admixture of any interest as a spring of action; they</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>were, however, only assumed to be categorical, because such an</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>assumption was necessary to explain the conception of duty. But we</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>could not prove independently that there are practical propositions</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>which command categorically, nor can it be proved in this section; one</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>thing, however, could be done, namely, to indicate in the imperative</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>itself, by some determinate expression, that in the case of volition</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>from duty all interest is renounced, which is the specific criterion</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of categorical as distinguished from hypothetical imperatives. This
is</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>done in the present (third) formula of the principle, namely, in the</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>idea of the will of every rational being as a universally</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>legislating will.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>For although a will which is subject to laws may be attached to this</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law by means of an interest, yet a will which is itself a supreme</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>lawgiver so far as it is such cannot possibly depend on any</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>interest, since a will so dependent would itself still need another</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>law restricting the interest of its self-love by the condition that
it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>should be valid as universal law.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Thus the principle that every human will is a will which in all</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>its maxims gives universal laws,* provided it be otherwise</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>justified, would be very well adapted to be the categorical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>imperative, in this respect, namely, that just because of the idea</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>of universal legislation it is not based on interest, and therefore
it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>alone among all possible imperatives can be unconditional. Or still</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>better, converting the proposition, if there is a categorical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>imperative (i.e., a law for the will of every rational being), it</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>can only command that everything be done from maxims of one's will</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>regarded as a will which could at the same time will that it should</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>itself give universal laws, for in that case only the practical</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>principle and the imperative which it obeys are unconditional, since</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>they cannot be based on any interest.</H3>
