<h3><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u>:</h3>
<h3>As an introduction to philosophy, this course (1) enquires into the foundations of ethics, by (2) considering how our conception of the human person affects our understanding of the good human life. It also (3) considers the question of the rationality of belief in God and the difference (if any) God&rsquo;s existence makes to our understanding of the person and the good. In addressing each of these topics, the course (4) develops and applies basic logical and critical thinking skills, introduced as an essential part of philosophical method. </h3>
<h3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the nature of the human person, ethics, and the existence of God--using philosophical methodology, and with substantial attention to Catholic intellectual tradition. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of the human person and the good human life.</h3>

<h3><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u>:<u></u></h3>
<h3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions.&nbsp;Reading of assigned texts is a&nbsp;<strong><u>MUST</u></strong>&nbsp;in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.&nbsp;There will be 12&nbsp;&ldquo;weekly&rdquo; quizzes on pre-assigned readings and class lectures, 3 Thought Experiments (TE&rsquo;s), and other extra credit opportunities your 8 best &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; quizzes and best TE and Food TE will count as 10% of your grade--and&nbsp;there are&nbsp;<strong><u>NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES</u></strong>.&nbsp;Your best 9 on-line book quizzes and writing assignment will be worth 20% of your grade. And there will also be 4 <strong>TESTS</strong> throughout the semester.&nbsp;Make-up TESTS are possible&nbsp;<strong>ONLY UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., your near-death or other kinds of serious illness that would involve a note from your doctor, a family or parenting-related emergency, or a UST-sponsored event--early purchase of an airline ticket for Spring Break does not count as such an excuse!).&nbsp;If you need to schedule a make-up you should see me&nbsp;<strong><u>ASAP</u></strong>&nbsp;to see if your situation meets the conditions under which a make-up may be taken. Make-up TESTS are completely different from regular tests and typically all-essay.&nbsp;There will also be at least two writing assignments required of each student--and late assignments will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late.&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.&nbsp;</h3>
