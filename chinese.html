<FONT SIZE=+0>THE GREAT LEARNING</FONT></H3>

<H3>(from the Book of Rites-Li Chi)</H3>

<H3>by &quot;Confucius&quot;</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>What The Great Learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue;
to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence. The point
of rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that
being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness
there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful
deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of
the desired end.</H3>

<H3>Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and
their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to
what is taught in the Great Learning.</H3>

<H3>The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout
the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well
their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their
families, they first cultivated their own persons. Wishing to cultivate
their own persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify
their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing
to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their
knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.</H3>

<H3>Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge
being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere,
their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons
were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated.
Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their
states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.</H3>

<H3>From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider
the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.</H3>

<H3>It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from
it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was of great
importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what
was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.<BR>
