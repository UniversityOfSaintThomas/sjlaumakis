<h1 align="center">A JAPANESE BUDDHIST VIEW  OF THE HUMAN PERSON--2</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. <strong><u>SLIDE #1</u></strong>--Japanese View &amp; Liquid Life--Densification (Human Becoming vs. Human Being)</h2>
<h2>2. <strong><u>SLIDE #2</u></strong>--Three Books: (1) William R. LaFleur--Liquid Life; (2) Helen Hardacre--Marketing the Menacing Fetus; and (3) Jeff Wilson--Mourning the Unborn Dead: A Buddhist Ritual Comes to America</h2>
<h2>3. <strong><u>SLIDE #3</u></strong>--Three pictures of Jizo Statues (Bottom picture shows numerous Jizo statues as part of Buddhist Temple ritual) Jizo is Bodhisattva--Enlightenment Being who cares for children and unborn</h2>
<h2>4. Mizuko Kuyo Ritual (Abortion illegal in Japan--but with exceptions for health of mother)</h2>
<h2>5. Mizuko = water child + Kuyo = Ritual</h2>
<h2>6. Moment of Conception (Liquid Life--Human Becoming)--&gt;Densification (on the way to becoming HP/Human Being)</h2>
<h2>7. <br>

  8. Body1--&gt;Body2--&gt;Body--&gt; and so on--What connects bodies and what exactly is passed on? Stream of Consciousness or &ldquo;Soul&rdquo;</h2>
<h2>9. When does human life begin? The Process of Densification takes place between during pre-birth to birth stages in the picture</h2>
<h2>10. The main arguments:</h2>
<h2>P1--If Liquid--&gt;then not HP <br>
  <u>P2--Liquid</u><br>
  So, Not HP</h2>
<h2>P1--If HP--&gt;then not Liquid<br>
  <u>P2--Liquid</u><br>
So, Not HP</h2>
<h2>11. So, if these arguments are sound, then miscarriage or abortion does not kill HP</h2>
<h2>12. In other words, Abortion sends being back to other realm--to be reborn at some later time (It redirects the flow of the stream of consciousness--it does not kill it)</h2>
<h2>13. But Mizuko Kuyo Ritual helps with feelings of guilt &amp; to assuage the upset fetus</h2>
<h2>14. Is all of this really authentically Buddhist? George Tanabe (UH, Manoa) says no</h2>
<h2>15. Helen Hardacre thinks the ritual was created to take advantage of women and raise money for the temples--and is really not about Buddhist beliefs about the HP</h2>
<h2>16. Regardless of the answer to that question, it should be clear that answers to moral questions depend on what one thinks about what makes something be a HP and when HP exists</h2>
