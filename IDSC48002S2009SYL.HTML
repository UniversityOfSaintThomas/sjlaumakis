Participation typically begins at a very early age (Little League baseball, Pop Warner football), progresses through junior and senior high school, and may culminate in a college or perhaps a professional career. Most athletes remain ardent supporters of their sports even when their playing days have ended. In fact, sport and athletics have been credited with improving self-esteem, enhancing the quality and number of friendships, increasing cooperation, accepting adversity, dedication to a cause, and perhaps many other desirable traits. However, one only needs to look in the daily newspaper to find many of the negative aspects of sports, from criminal behavior to illegal substance use to betting on and fixing contests. As a result, the primary purpose of this seminar is to examine the positive and negative educational, social, psychological, physical, and financial effects of athletic participation for both the athlete and society in general. &nbsp; More generally, what are we to believe about the value of sport to society? This seminar will explore this relationship. </h2><h2><strong>SEMINAR STRUCTURE </strong>: </h2><h2>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts. &nbsp; The first part will be concerned with briefly outlining basic ethical theories and various approaches to the value of athletics. &nbsp; The second part will be concerned with the relationship between sports and education. &nbsp; The third part will focus on particular issues related to sports and society. </h2><h2>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week. &nbsp; Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings. </h2><h2><strong>TEXTS </strong>: </h2><h2>Bradley, Bill. <strong>Values of the Game </strong>. </h2><h2>Sperber, Murray. <strong>Beer and Circus </strong>. </h2><h2>Selected Readings related to weekly topics. </h2><h2><strong>ASSIGNMENTS </strong>: </h2><h2>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. &nbsp; The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks) as we present an overview of the issues involved in athletcs. &nbsp; It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. &nbsp; Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h2><h2>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading. </h2><h2>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION </strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar. </h2><h2>2) <strong> REACTION PAPERS </strong> are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assigned readings. &nbsp; These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. &nbsp; The papers will be evaluated on a "+/0/-" scale. &nbsp; "-" is missing or deficient (D-F). "0" is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). "+" is a thoughtful analysis (A). </h2><h2>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING </strong> consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic. &nbsp; Students will be responsible for leading discussion twice. </h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY </strong>: </h2><h2>Attendance is expected. &nbsp; Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. &nbsp; Turn off your cell phones! </h2><h2><strong>GRADE DISTRIBUTION </strong>: </h2><h2>Participation/Web = 30% </h2><h2>Reaction Papers = 30% </h2><h2>Discussion Leading (First time) = 15% </h2><h2>Discussion Leading (Second time) = 15% </h2><h2>Additional 10% </h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2></BODY></HTML>
