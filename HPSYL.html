<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>As an introduction to philosophy, the course will focus on the fundamental
conceptions of the nature of the human person in ancient, medieval, modern,
and contemporary philosophy. It will also include the development of basic
logical and critical thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background
for future reflections on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject
matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting
the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to
the nature of the human person. It is expected by the end of the semester
that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and
be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of
the human person.</H3>

you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation,
pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be

PAGES) on pre-assigned readings and topics. There will also be 2 EXAMS--a
Mid-Term Exam and a Final Exam at the end of the semester.</H3>
