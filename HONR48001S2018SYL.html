<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<h3>Heresy, apostasy, blasphemy, blindness of mind, dullness of sense, despair, presumption, hatred, discord, contention, schism, war, strife, sedition, scandal, folly, imprudence, negligence, craftiness, guile, fraud, injustice, murder, theft, reviling backbiting, tale-bearing, derision, cursing, cheating, usury, superstition, idolatry, perjury, sacrilege, simony, disobedience, ingratitude, vengeance, lying, hypocrisy, boasting, irony, affability, flattery, quarreling, vainglory, pusillanimity, meanness, effeminacy, pertinacity, insensibility, intemperance, cowardice, drunkenness, incontinence, cruelty, not to mention pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust are among the personal dispositions described by Thomas Aquinas as vices. According to Aquinas, a vice is an internal characteristic of a person, which disposes one to act against one's true nature. Vices begin as a person follows the inclination of his or her sensitive nature instead of one's rational nature. In other words, a vice is a personal trait that leads one to act immorally. </h3>
<h3>Contemporary culture, on the other hand, tends to psychologize, trivialize, and often dismiss the notion of vice and the seven deadly sins as having little or no serious moral or spiritual implications. As a result, the purpose of this seminar is to examine the traditional conception of vice from within the context of contemporary culture. Students will critically analyze Aquinas&rsquo; understanding of vice and assess its adequacy given general views of morality in American life and culture.</h3>
<h3>Readings will include primary and secondary sources in philosophy and theology. Students<br>
  will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction <br>
  papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading. </h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>1. Gaining a basic understanding of the subject (i.e., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories).</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>2. To acquire skills in working with others as a member of a team.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>3. Developing skill in expressing oneself orally and in writing.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>4. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly two parts.</h3>
<h3>The first part will focus on the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of moral theories and the virtues and vices in general. The second part will focus more narrowly on specific vices as conceptualized by Thomas Aquinas. Students will be asked to consider the relationship between Aquinas&rsquo; medieval theological conception and our modern psychological and philosophical understandings of the vices.</h3>
<h3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in on-line  discussions of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.  Students are expected to devote about 3-4 hours of study each week to this seminar.</h3>
<h3>NB: We realize that we live in the age of social media and constant connectivity. A seminar style, however, relies on effective communication skills from all involved. That means not only effectively presenting your ideas, but also listening attentively to others. To listen effectively you need to disconnect from e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, web surfing and other digital distractions during class time. If you bring a laptop or tablet to class it should be used only for class-related activities.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>TEXTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Aquinas, Thomas. <strong><u>Summa Theologiae</u></strong>--specific articles on the virtues and vices.<br>
  Cunningham, Lawrence S. (2012). <strong><u>The Seven Deadly Sins: A Visitor&rsquo;s Guide</u></strong><br>
  DeYoung, Rebecca Konyndyk (2009). <strong><u>Glittering Vices.</u></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks, at most) as we present an overview of the philosophy of sport and the social issues related to sports in society. It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h3>
<h3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Leading Discussion.</h3>
<h3>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.&nbsp; Students should be prepared for cold-calling during any class!</h3>
<h3>2) <strong>REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.&nbsp; These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.&nbsp; The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale.&nbsp; &ldquo;1&ldquo; is missing or deficient (D-F). &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).&nbsp;A grade of &quot;5&quot; is reserved for good analysis and is NOT easily attained!</h3>
<h3>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2-3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2-3), and then leading class discussion during the weeks you present the issues involved in your topics.&nbsp; Students will be responsible for leading discussion 2-3 times.&nbsp; </h3>
<h3><strong><u>ATTENDANCE POLICY</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones! </h3>
<h3><strong><u>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Participation/Web = 40%<br>
  Reaction Papers = 30%<br>
  Discussion Leading = 20%<br>
  Additional 10% (Add in where you want!)</h3>
<h3><br>
  <strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This is an Honors Seminar--Students will be graded accordingly! </h3>
