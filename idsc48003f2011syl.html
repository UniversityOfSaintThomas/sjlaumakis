<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </H3>
<H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly two parts.  </H3>
<H3>The course will begin with basic tutorials addressing the scope of environmental problems (NWEI & TED talks).  Initial classroom presentations by professors will lay the groundwork for students to discover and develop their own presentations about an environmental issue of their choice.  Debates, based on the Easton Text, will strengthen their analytic skills and their knowledge of ecology and human behavior.  Students will gain additional experience using this knowledge and skill by assessing the accuracy, ethics and effectiveness of various media depictions of environmental crises.  A final paper will require students to integrate their reading of Leopold’s classic, A Sand County Almanac, with material gathered throughout the semester.</H3>
<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line 
  discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the 
  readings.  </H3>
<H3>TEXTS:  </H3>
<H3>Easton, Thomas A. (2011) Taking Sides: Clashing Views on the Environment (14th Edition)</H3>

<h3>ASSIGNMENTS:</h3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks--at most) as we present an overview of the Theological and Philosophical issues involved in the question of conversion.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for three areas of activity:  </H3>
<H3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion Leading, and 4) A Final Paper.  </H3>
<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.  </H3>
<H3>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-TYPED PAGE in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.  These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.  The papers will be evaluated on a “+/0/-“ scale.  “-“ is missing or deficient (D-F). “0” is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). “+” is a thoughtful analysis (A).  </H3>
<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic.  Students will be responsible for leading discussion two times.  </H3>
<H3>4) FINAL PAPER will integrate your reading of Leopold’s classic, A Sand County Almanac, with material gathered throughout the semester</H3>
