<h3><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u>:</h3>
<h3>As an introduction to philosophy, this course (1) enquires into the foundations of ethics, by (2) considering how our conception of the human person affects our understanding of the good human life. It also (3) considers the question of the rationality of belief in God and the difference (if any) God&rsquo;s existence makes to our understanding of the person and the good. In addressing each of these topics, the course (4) develops and applies basic logical and critical thinking skills, introduced as an essential part of philosophical method. </h3>
<h3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the nature of the human person, ethics, and the existence of God--using philosophical methodology, and with substantial attention to Catholic intellectual tradition. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of the human person and the good human life.</h3>

<h3><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u>:<u></u></h3>
<h3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions.&nbsp; Reading of assigned texts is a&nbsp;<strong><u>MUST</u></strong>&nbsp;in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.&nbsp; </h3>
<h3>There will be 3 TESTS throughout the summer session--each worth 20% of your final grade. (Make-up TESTS are possible ONLY UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES (i.e., your near-death or other kinds of serious illness that would involve a note from your doctor, a family or parenting-related emergency, or a UST-sponsored event). If you need to schedule a make-up you should see me ASAP to see if your situation meets the conditions under which a make-up may be taken. Make-up TESTS are completely different from regular tests and typically all-essay.) There will also be 12 &ldquo;daily&rdquo; quizzes on pre-assigned readings and class lectures, and 2 Thought Experiments (TE&rsquo;s)--your 9 best &ldquo;daily&rdquo; quizzes and best TE will count as 20% of your grade--and there are NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES--and late assignments will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late. Your 10 best online book quizzes will also count as the last 20% of your final grade. Finally, for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.</h3>
