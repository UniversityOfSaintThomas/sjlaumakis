scandal, folly, imprudence, negligence, craftiness, guile, fraud, injustice,

insensibility, intemperance, cowardice, drunkenness, incontinence, cruelty,
not to mention pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust are
among the personal dispositions described by Thomas Aquinas as vices. According
to Aquinas, a vice is an internal characteristic of a person, which disposes
one to act against one's true nature. Vices begin as a person follows the
inclination of his or her sensitive nature instead of one's rational nature.
In other words, a vice is a personal trait that leads one to act immorally.
The objective of this seminar is to examine a medieval concept of vice and
particular vices from within the context of contemporary culture. Students
will critically analyze Aquinas' understanding of vice and assess its adequacy
given general views of morality in American life and culture.</H3>

<H3>Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation,
reaction papers, and in-class presentations and discussion leading.</H3>

<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:</H3>

<H3>The seminar will be divided into two parts: the first part (the first
two weeks) will be directed by Drs. Brady and Laumakis; the second part
(the last twelve weeks) will be student led discussions of the works of
Thomas Aquinas and Ken Bazyn.</H3>

<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to prepare ten
reaction papers. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student
presentations based on the readings.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Aquinas, Thomas, Selections from his Summa Theologiae (Available at

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin
with a lecture format (two weeks) as we present an overview of Aristotle'
s and Aquinas' versions of Virtue Theory Ethics. It will then proceed in
seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. Students
will be responsible for three areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction
Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.</H3>

<H3>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assigned
readings. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on
the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a &quot;+/0/-&quot; scale. &quot;-&quot;
is missing or deficient (D-F). &quot;0&quot; is an adequate summary with
little or no analysis (B-C). &quot;+&quot; is a thoughtful analysis (A).</H3>

<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by
WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during
the week you present the issues involved in your topic. Students will be
responsible for leading discussion twice.</H3>
