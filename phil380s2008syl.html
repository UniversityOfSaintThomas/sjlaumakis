STEPHEN J. LAUMAKIS </h3><h3>OFFICE: 207JRC </h3><h3>PHONE: 962-5363 </h3><h3>OFFICE HOURS: 10:45-12 MWF &amp; 9:15-9:45 TTH &amp; BY APPOINTMENT </h3><h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS : </h3><h3>The subject matter of this course is the various accounts of the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge and knowing found in the writings of ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary philosophers. &nbsp; We will also consider the same topics in the Buddhist traditions. &nbsp; The central focus of the course involves an analysis of the three traditional components of human knowledge: belief, truth, and justification. Particular emphasis will be placed on exploring the nature of the relationship between the individual knower and the community to which he or she belongs. </h3><h3>The aim of the course is to enrich your understanding of philosophy and the activities of philosophers by presenting the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to human knowing and human knowledge. &nbsp; It is expected by the end of the semester that you both have some understanding of the richness and complexity of several different theories of knowledge and be able to articulate coherently your own answers to some basic questions in epistemology. </h3><h3>REQUIRED TEXTS : </h3><h3>Laumakis, Stephen J., <strong>An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy </strong></h3><h3>Moser, Paul K. &amp; Vander Nat, Arnold, <strong>Human Knowledge </strong></h3><h3>SELECTED HANDOUTS </h3><h3>ASSIGNMENTS : </h3><h3>Since this is an upper level course emphasizing the understanding and integration of complex and interrelated ideas, you are asked to concentrate on assimilating these philosophical concepts and notions. &nbsp; Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. &nbsp; The course will begin with a lecture format (roughly 3 weeks) as we review the basic issues involved in epistemology. &nbsp; It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. &nbsp; There will be 1 SHORT PAPER (2-3 typed pages in length and NOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES ) on a pre-assigned reading and 1 LONGER PAPER (4-5 typed pages in length and NOT MORE THAN 6 TYPED PAGES ) on your own account of human knowing. &nbsp; The first or SHORTER PAPER will be presented to the class along with a one-page outline. Late papers will be penalized one full grade for each day they are late. &nbsp; There will also be 2 EXAMS--a Mid-Term Exam and a Final Exam at the end of the semester. </h3><h3>ATTENDANCE POLICY : </h3><h3>Attendance is expected. &nbsp; Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones. </h3><h3>GRADE DISTRIBUTION : </h3><h3>Participation= 20% &nbsp;&nbsp; Short Paper= 10% &nbsp;&nbsp; Longer Paper = &nbsp; 20% &nbsp;&nbsp; Mid-Term= 25% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final= 25% </h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3></BODY></HTML>
