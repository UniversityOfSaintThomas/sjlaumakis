<P><B>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS</B>:</P>

<P>	Twenty-five years ago in &quot;Sports in America&quot; James Michener
wrote, &quot;Sports have become a major force in American life.  We devote
more money and time to them than we realize.  They consume a major portion
of our television programming, and our newspapers allocate tremendous space
to their coverage.Their effect upon our schools and colleges is oftentimes
deplorable, and they have been accused of generating at least some of the
violence that assaults us.&quot;  Recent events at the University of Minnesota
and other incidents involving both amateur and professional athletes seem
to confirm Michener's claims.</P>

<P>	Sports are obviously a significant feature of our society.  In fact,
almost all Americans are at some time or another participants in or spectators
of sports.  However, we very rarely pause to reflect upon the meaning and
significance of these activities-for ourselves or for society.  As a result,
this seminar is designed to provide a structured opportunity for philosophical
reflection on the nature, history, and practice of sports in America.  It
will help students develop: 1. a vocabulary of terms and concepts for the
philosophical study of sports, 2. a framework for critically evaluating
the strengths and weaknesses of the practice of sports, and 3. a personal
understanding of the effects of sports on society.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</B>:</P>

<P>	The seminar will be divided into roughly four parts.  The first part
will be concerned with specifying the basic principles, definitions and
distinctions among such key terms as &quot;play,&quot; &quot;sport,&quot;
and &quot;games.&quot;  It will also consider the various ways of participating
in sports and play.  The second part will be concerned with the relationship
between sports and society.  In addition to who plays and why, this part
will consider the effects of sports on social institutions.  The third and
largest part of the seminar will be concerned with ethical issues in sports.
 It will consider the role and participation of women in sports, sports
and the media, money and financing, and the role of government in organized
sports.  The impact of sports on colleges and universities will receive
special attention.  The fourth part will be concerned with the effect of
sports on individuals.  It will consider questions about how sports leads
to self-knowledge, the mind and body relationship, sports and aesthetics,
why individuals participate in sports and the role of sports throughout
life.</P>

<P>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate
in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction
paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and
to student presentations based on the readings.</P>

<P>We will also have several guest speakers including: the UST athletic
director, coaches from men's and women's teams, and a member of the local
media.</P>

<P><B>ASSIGNMENTS</B>:</P>

<P>	Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The course will begin
with a lecture format (roughly 4 weeks) as we present an overview of Philosophy
of Sports.  It will then proceed in seminar style with <B>SIGNIFICANT</B>
emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for four
areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion
Leading, and 4) a Final Project/Paper. </P>

<P>1)   <B>PARTICIPATION</B> includes class discussion of the assigned readingsand
Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar. The
site is at: webcampus5.stthomas.edu/webct/public/show_courses.pl?964095575</P>

<P>Students <B>MUST</B> post at least one reaction to the readings each
week.</P>

<P>2) <B>WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS</B> are <B>1 TYPED PAGE</B> in length and
are based on the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion
Area postings for the week.  Students responsible for Discussion Leading
in class will be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during that week.
 They will, however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</P>

<P>3) <B>DISCUSSION LEADING</B> consists of forming a group of 3 students
(by WEEK #3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #3), meeting with Mr. Riverso &amp;
Dr. Laumakis to discuss the readings (at least two weeks before your topic
is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion on the
Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion during the week
you present the issues involved in your topic.</P>

<P>4) <B>THE FINAL PROJECT/PAPER</B> consists of either a synthesis of your
Weekly Reaction Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treated
in them or an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topic
or theme treated in the seminar.  Late papers will be penalized one full
grade for each day they are late.</P>
