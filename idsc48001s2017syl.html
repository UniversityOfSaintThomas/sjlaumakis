<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:  </H3>
<h3>This seminar will investigate philosophical and psychological accounts and approaches
  to the subject of willpower.&nbsp; We will investigate the latest scientific explanations of the processes involved in building what many thinkers consider our greatest virtue and strength: 
  self-control.&nbsp; Through readings from philosophers (from both the East &amp; West) and psychologists we will examine how willpower or self-control works, why it matters, and what we can do to
  develop and strengthen our self-discipline or willpower.</h3>
<h3>Philosophers from both Eastern and Western traditions have offered arguments and advice about how to live good and successful lives.&nbsp; One important and common element among their various accounts has been the role of self-discipline, self-control, or willpower.&nbsp; Recently, Western scientists and psychologists have begun to focus on a scientific understanding of the brain and how diverse disciplinary practices not only change the brain, but also improve one&rsquo;s chances of exercising better self-control and self-discipline. Given these different and sometimes competing conceptions of how to understand and improve one&rsquo;s willpower, this seminar will investigate both the philosophical and scientific approaches to the mind and one&rsquo;s will power.</h3>
<h3>Readings will include primary and secondary sources from each discipline.&nbsp; Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, 
  in-class presentations and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>The seminar will be taught by a philosopher (Laumakis) and a psychologist (Robinson-Riegler)
  with research interests and publications in the philosophical and psychological studies of human
  nature and its cognitive powers and functions.</h3>
<H3>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES:  </H3>
<H3>1. 	Gaining factual knowledge and fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories

<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </H3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly&nbsp;three parts.&nbsp; The first part will be concerned with outlining basic Eastern and Western philosophical accounts of willpower and self-control, and&nbsp;contemporary psychological and scientific accounts of willpower.&nbsp; The&nbsp;second part will consider the benefits of cultivating willpower or self-discipline, and will involve choosing and reporting on your own personal application of willpower. The third and largest part of the seminar will focus on the empirical foundations/justifications of willpower/self-control as found in the course text.</h3>
<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.  </H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:  </H3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, 
  facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a lecture format in the first week as we present an overview 
  of Philosophical and Psychological approaches to consciousness and mindfulness.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for four areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.  </H3>
<h3>1) &nbsp; <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings. It is critical that you read, reflect, and come ready to discuss. Participation  also includes <strong>WILLPOWER BLOGS</strong>. We want you to seek out opportunities to exercise self-control, and to reflect on your efforts at improving your willpower (outside of just thinking about the readings). What do you experience? Of course, please respond to the posts of others; we want these to be on-going conversations. Everyone should be active in both class discussions and blog discussions. Active engagement (consistent and substantive contributions just about every week) in both will be necessary for an &quot;A&quot; on this component. </h3>
<h3>2)<strong> &nbsp; REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGES</u> in length and are based on the reading for that week. These ten (10) papers should be a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The paper will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale--where 1 is, well, you wrote something that is only tangentially related to the subject of willpower and not connected to anything in the reading(s); 2 is slightly better--but with little indication that you did the reading(s); 3 means you did the reading and summarized them; 4 means you offered some analysis--at least something beyond a mere summary; and 5 is a good critical analysis and/or practical application of the reading(s).--and NOT easily earned. These reaction papers are different from the blogs in that they will provide a critical reflection&nbsp;on the topics covered in the reading.&nbsp; These critical analysis papers will be evaluated separately by&nbsp;each instructor who will then mutually agree on a grade.</h3>
<h3>3) &nbsp; <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 2 students (by WEEK #3), selecting a topic/week&nbsp; (by WEEK #2) and leading class discussion during that week Discussion leaders work in teams of 2-3, and will be responsible for coming up with a set of discussion points or questions that correspond to the reading for that week. These questions&nbsp; must be posted by NOON the Sunday before class. Discussion leaders will also be responsible for finding some interesting outside reading and/or ideas to report on or work into class discussion. Many relevant resources (perhaps all you need) are posted on the course Blackboard site, under &quot;Links&quot; and &quot;Outside Readings&quot;.</h3>
<h3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:  </h3>
<H3>Attendance is expected.  Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones! Especially in this class!  </H3>

  (25% in-class, 15% blog)  </H3>
<H3>Reaction Papers = 35%  </H3>
<H3>Discussion Leading = 15%  </H3>
