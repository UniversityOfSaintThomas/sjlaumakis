<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The disciplines of philosophy and psychology have always been closely
aligned, and have traditionally been concerned with specifying the nature
of the mind and its activities. In fact, philosophy (along with physiology/biology)
is considered a &quot;parent&quot; discipline of psychology. However, at
the same time, psychology is often contrasted with philosophy in terms of
the distinct methodologies it uses for investigating issues of mind and
intelligence. For example, psychology tends to take an empirical approach,
attempting to delineate the workings of the mind through controlled observation
and experimentation. Philosophy, on the other hand, is generally identified
with a rationalistic or more theoretical approach to questions about the
mind and intelligence. Nevertheless, the roots of contemporary scientific
psychology can be traced to a host of what might be termed &quot;scientific
philosophers&quot; (such as Democritus, Aristotle, and Aquinas) who believed
that the functions of the human mind could be explained in a clear and deterministic
fashion.</H3>

<H3>This seminar will explore attempts by philosophers and cognitive psychologists
to specify the nature of mind and intelligence. The course will be organized
thematically, focusing on specific philosophical (i.e., Metaphysical and
Epistemological) and psychological (i.e., Biological, Learning, Cognitive,
Developmental, and Socio-Cultural) accounts of mind and intelligence. Questions
to be considered include: How do the perspectives of philosophy and psychology
inform us about these topics? How are these perspectives related? Distinct?
Are they consistent? Contradictory? How are the Eastern and Western philosophical
perspectives related? Are both sets of perspectives (i.e., philosophy and
psychology and East and West) necessary for a complete understanding of
mind and intelligence, or does one provide a more complete or satisfactory
account? Readings will include primary and secondary sources from each discipline
and tradition. Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion
and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations
and discussion leading, and a final paper.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Seminar Structure:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly four parts. The first part
will be concerned with briefly outlining the basic philosophical accounts
of mind and intelligence. In addition to the most influential Western views,
this part will consider important Eastern theories as well. The second part
will be concerned with the most prominent psychological accounts of mind
and intelligence. The third part will focus on specific topics within the
philosophical and psychological approaches to the human mind and human intelligence.
The fourth part will be concerned with questions about animal and machine
intelligence as well as with human stupidity.</H3>

<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate
in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction
paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and
to student presentations based on the readings.</H3>

<H3>A final paper will be required of each student. A topic will be selected
early in the class and students will accumulate material from each section
of the course to incorporate in their final paper.</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The course will begin
with a lecture format (roughly 2 weeks) as we present an overview of Philosophy
of Mind and Cognitive Psychology. It will then proceed in seminar style
with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible
for four areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers,
3) Discussion Leading, and 4) a Final Project/Paper.</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.
Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each week-by Monday
at midnight.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>2) WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS are 1 TYPED PAGE in length and are based on
the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion Area
postings for the week. Students responsible for Discussion Leading in class
will be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during that week. They will,
however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by
WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), meeting with Dr. Robinson-Riegler
&amp; Dr. Laumakis to discuss the readings (at least two weeks before your
topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion
on the Web prior to your discussions, and leading class discussion during
the week you present the issues involved in your topic. A second &quot;GROUP
PRESENTATION&quot; will occur during the last four weeks of the seminar.
Students should seek membership in a group with those of similar interests.
Possible topics for the second group presentation will be discussed in class.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>4) THE FINAL PROJECT/PAPER consists of either a synthesis of your Weekly
Reaction Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treated in
them or an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topic or
theme treated in the seminar. Late papers will be penalized one full grade
for each day they are late.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.</H3>
