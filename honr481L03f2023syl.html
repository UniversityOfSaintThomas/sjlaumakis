COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:

This seminar will explore attempts by psychologists and Buddhists to understand consciousness. The course will be organized topically, focusing on both Western philosophical and psychological accounts of consciousness and Buddhist theory and practice.  

 The views to be considered include: recent work by cognitive psychologists, cognitive scientists, and the teachings of the Buddha as they have been interpreted by his Theravada, Mahayana, and Tibetan followers. Readings will include primary and secondary sources from each discipline. Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading. 

The notion of consciousness--our awareness of the internal and external world--has always been a topic of intense interest to philosophers and scientists, both Eastern and Western. The Western approach has tended to rely on the scientific method, using empirical investigations and objective inquiry to specify the nature of consciousness. A recent approach to understanding the nature of consciousness and thought (which has emerged and gained prominence over the past 75 years) is termed cognitive science.  Cognitive science represents an interdisciplinary attempt to understand the nature of thinking, and is rooted primarily in the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and anthropology.  Perhaps the most lively interaction among these disciplines lies at the crossroads of the first three--philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology (more specifically, cognitive psychology).  In fact, much current work in cognitive science is focused on trying to respond to basic philosophical questions about psychological processes (e.g., What is the nature of consciousness?) with the tools of brain science (e.g., brain imaging techniques such as PET scanning).   

Eastern approaches (Buddhism, in particular) are also devoted to investigating and understanding consciousness. However, their focus is on the analysis of subjective experience through meditative practice, and the cultivation of mindfulness—being awake and fully aware. Buddhists are especially concerned with the practical and moral consequences of this meditative practice. This subjective and contemplative approach to analyzing consciousness can be seen in Western approaches in the form of analytic introspection (a popular tool for analyzing consciousness early in the development of psychology), but was largely abandoned as unscientific. Recently, however, the phenomenological aspects of cognition and consciousness have made a comeback, and there has been an important meeting of Eastern and Western minds with regard to the analysis of consciousness. Both traditions are investigating the benefits of meditation for psychological and physical well-being, as well as what the meditative state tells us about the nature of consciousness and thought.
