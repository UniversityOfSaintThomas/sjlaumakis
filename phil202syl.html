<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>This course in the history of philosophy examines major themes and philosophers
of the Medieval period (400-1400).  It will trace the historical development
of philosophical thought by highlighting the fundamental ideas in the thought
of several important thinkers (i.e., Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Bonaventure
and Aquinas).  The aim of the course is to introduce you to Medieval thought
by presenting the questions that Medieval philosophers thought about (i.e.,
the relationship of faith &amp; reason, the existence of God, the problem
of universals, and the nature of mystical experience) and by exploring their
answers to them.  It is expected by the end of the semester that you know
something of the thought of several major thinkers and appreciate the rich
and complex history of Medieval thought.</H3>
