Philosophers and theologians throughout   history have considered this question. Some paradigmatic figures have presented   a model for the good human life through their example and teachings that has   stood the test of time and become &#8220;classic.&#8221;<br>  <br>  This seminar will examine four exemplary lives, each of which has spawned millions   of imitators. We will study the lives and teachings of the Buddha, Confucius   (Kongzi), Socrates, and Jesus. We will consider them primarily as human beings   and as role models, rather than as objects of worship and/or the basis of organized   religions or philosophical systems. We do not mean to exclude the possibility   of divine status for any particular figure, only to emphasize that we will study   them qua human and as the blazers of a &#8220;path&#8221; that other humans   can aspire to, rather than as otherworldly figures with a status that is unattainable   by their followers. Hence the course is not about Platonism, Buddhism, Confucianism,   and Christianity, but Socrates, Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  This seminar is designed to provide a structured opportunity for philosophical   and theological reflection on four of the most influential accounts of the meaning   and purpose of life and what happens afterward. It will help students develop   (1) a vocabulary of terms and concepts for considering questions about the good   human life, (2) a framework for critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses   of four of the most influential answers to these questions, and (3) a personal   understanding of the effects of these views on both individual human actions   and society.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  SEMINAR STRUCTURE:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  The seminar will be divided into four parts. We will begin by considering various   philosophical and theological notions of &#8220;the meaning and purpose of life&#8221;   and &#8220;salvation.&#8221; The first part will then be concerned with the   Buddha and Buddhist conceptions of &#8220;nirvana.&#8221; The second part will   be concerned with the teaching of Confucius and other Chinese conceptions of   the goal of life. The third part will focus on the life, beliefs, and arguments   of Socrates. The fourth part will be concerned with the life and teachings of   Jesus.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an   on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper   for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student   presentations based on the readings.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  A final paper will be required of each student. A topic will be selected early   in the class and students will accumulate material from each section of the   course to incorporate in their final paper.<br>  In-class movies and a field trip to the Minneapolis Institute of Art are also   planned.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  TEXTS:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  1. Conze, Buddhist Scriptures<br>  2. Confucius, Analects<br>  3. Fingarette, Confucius&#8212;The Secular As Sacred<br>  4. Jaspers, Socrates, Buddha, Confucius, Jesus<br>  5. Plato, Five Dialogues<br>  6. Wills, What Jesus Meant</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  ASSIGNMENTS:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject   matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions,   and just plain make you think. The course will begin with a lecture format (roughly   2 weeks) as we present an overview of the lives and thought of Socrates, the   Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus. It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT   emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for three areas   of activity: 1) Participation (both in class and on the web), 2) Discussion   Leading, and 3) a Final Paper.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left> <br>  1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and Web   postings at the Blackboard Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.   Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each week. Students   will be graded on both the quality and quantity of their participation. Participation   will count 40% of the final grade.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  2) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of choosing a date and selected reading and meeting   with Dr. Landry &amp; Dr. Laumakis to discuss the readings (at least one week   before your topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion   on the Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion. This component   of students&#8217; work for the seminar will be evaluated in terms of the time   and effort students put into formulating questions for the web and class discussions,   and the quality of the conversation student leaders are able to elicit from   the members of the seminar on the topic. Discussion leading will count 20% of   the final grade.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  3) THE FINAL PAPER consists of an extended (5-8 pages) discussion and evaluation   of some topic or theme treated in the seminar. Late papers will be penalized   one full grade for each day they are late. The paper will count 40% of the final   grade.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.</H2></BODY></HTML>
