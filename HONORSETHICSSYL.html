<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>As an introduction to ethics, the course will focus on the historical
and philosophical origins of human reflections on the ultimate end and meaning
of human life as well as on the morality of human acts. It will also trace
the development of philosophical reflection on moral custom by highlighting
the fundamental ideas in the thought of several important philosophers.
Finally, we will examine in some detail the practical consequences of a
specific ethical view.</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to ethics by presenting the
questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the
morality of human actions. It is expected by the end of the semester that
you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able
to articulate coherently your own understanding of the good/best life for
human beings.</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>Since this is a basic, foundation-type course emphasizing the understanding
of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental
ethical notions. Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce
you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation,
pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be
3 SHORT PAPERS (2-3 typed pages in length and NOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES)
on pre-assigned readings. One of these papers will be presented in class
(with a one-page outline for each member of the class). Late papers will
be penalized one full grade for each day they are late. There will also
be at least 2 EXAMS/TESTS.</H3>

<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3>

<H3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.</H3>
