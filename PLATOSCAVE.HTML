<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>PLATO'S CAVE</H1>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Allegory of the Cave<HR></H2>

<P><B></B>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>[514a] And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
enlightened or unenlightened: -- Behold! Human beings living in a underground
den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the
den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks
chained so that they cannot move, [514b] and can only see before them, being
prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind
them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners
there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along
the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them,
over which they show the puppets. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>I see.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying [514c] all
sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone
and various materials, [515a] which appear over the wall? Some of them are
talking, others silent. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the
shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the
cave? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were
never allowed [515b] to move their heads? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
only see the shadows? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Yes, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose
that they were naming what was actually before them? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Very true. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke
that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>No question, he replied. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>[515c] To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the
shadows of the images. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>That is certain. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners
are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is
liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and
walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will
distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his
former state he had seen the shadows; [515d] and then conceive some one
saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when
he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real
existence, he has a clearer vision, -- what will be his reply? And you may
further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass
and requiring him to name them, will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy
that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which
are now shown to him? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Far truer. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, [515e] will he
not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take
in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to
be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>True, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
rugged ascent, and held fast until he's forced into the presence of the
sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? [516a] When he
approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to
see anything at all of what are now called realities.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Not all in a moment, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world.
And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and
other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will
gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and
he will see the sky and the stars [516b] by night better than the sun or
the light of the sun by day? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Certainly.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of
him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in
another; and he will contemplate him as he is.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Certainly. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, [516c]
and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
been accustomed to behold? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and
his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself
on the change, and pity them? </H3>

<H3>Certainly, he would. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And if they were in the habit of conferring honors among themselves
on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
which of them went before, [516d] and which followed after, and which were
together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the
future, do you think that he would care for such honors and glories, or
envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer, </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>&quot;Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,&quot; </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>and to endure anything, rather than think as they do [516e] and live
after their manner? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain
these false notions and live in this miserable manner. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun
to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his
eyes full of darkness? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>To be sure, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And if there were a contest, and he had to compete [517a] in measuring
the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while
his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the
time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very
considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he
went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even
to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him
up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him
to death. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>No question, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the
previous argument; [517b] the prison-house is the world of sight, the light
of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world
according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed --
whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion
is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all,
and is seen only with an effort; [517c] and, when seen, is also inferred
to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of
light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate
source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power
upon which he who would act rationally, either in public or private life
must have his eye fixed. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls
are ever hastening into the upper world [517d] where they desire to dwell;
which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.
</H3>

<H3>Yes, very natural. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations
to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if,
while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding
darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places,
about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavoring
to meet [517e] the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute
justice? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Anything but surprising, he replied. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Any one who has common sense [518a] will remember that the bewilderments
of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming
out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's
eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when
he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready
to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the
brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, [518b]
or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.
And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and
he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which
comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than
in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into
the den. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>That, he said, is a very just distinction. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
[518c] when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was
not there before, like sight into blind eyes. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>They undoubtedly say this, he replied. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning
exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn
from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of
knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the
world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the
sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, [518d] or in other
words, of the good. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Very true.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest
and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists
already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away
from the truth? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin
to bodily qualities, [518e] for even when they are not originally innate
they can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom
more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains,
and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; [519a] or, on
the other hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow intelligence
flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue -- how eager he is, how clearly
his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but
his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he is mischievous
in proportion to his cleverness. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Very true, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days
of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,
such as eating and drinking, [519b] which, like leaden weights, were attached
to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of
their souls upon the things that are below -- if, I say, they had been released
from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the very same
faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their
eyes are turned to now. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Very likely. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a
necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
and uninformed of the truth, [519c] nor yet those who never make an end
of their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because
they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions,
private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not act at
all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart
in the Islands of the Blest. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Very true, he replied. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will
be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already
shown to be the greatest of all -- they must continue to ascend [519d] until
they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen enough we
must not allow them to do as they do now. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>What do you mean? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed;
they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and partake
of their labors and honors, whether they are worth having or not.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,
when they might have a better? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>[519e] You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of
the legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy
above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held
the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors
of the State, [520a] and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end
he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in
binding up the State. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>True, he said, I had forgotten. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our
philosophers to have a care and providence of others; [520b] we shall explain
to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to share
in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their
own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught,
they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have
never received. But we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the
hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated you
far better [520c] and more perfectly than they have been educated, and you
are better able to share in the double duty. Wherefore each of you, when
his turn comes, must go down to the general underground abode, and get the
habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you will
see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den, and you will
know what the several images are, and what they represent, because you have
seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our State
which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be
administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which men fight
with one another [520d] about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle
for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that
the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the
best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager,
the worst. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Quite true, he replied. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn
at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of
their time with one another in the heavenly light? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>[520e] Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands
which we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one
of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion
of our present rulers of State. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive
for your future rulers another and a better life [521a] than that of a ruler,
and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which
offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,
but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas
if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after
their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the
chief good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office,
and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the
rulers themselves and of the whole State. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>[521b] Most true, he replied. And the only life which looks down upon
the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy. Do you know of
any other? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Indeed, I do not, he said. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they
are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight. </H3>

<H3>No question. </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they
will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State
is best administered, and who at the same time have other honors and another
and a better life than that of politics? </H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.<BR>
