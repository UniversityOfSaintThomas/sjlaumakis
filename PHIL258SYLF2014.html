<h3><strong><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>As the university Undergraduate Catalog indicates, this course is concerned with ethical issues arising from human interaction with the environment, including global climate change, population pressure, pollution, conservation, and preservation. Particular attention will be given to investigating the philosophical grounds for justifying our beliefs and actions with respect to the environment in these and related matters. The course will provide a broad array of philosophical arguments in support of responses to questions about what persons and things are worthy of moral consideration, and the roles of individuals, organizations, and governments in addressing environmental issues and problems. It is expected by the end of the semester that you will be familiar with the history of environmental ethics, and know the essential features and arguments of the ethical traditions considered in the course. The course will also help you consider the strengths and weaknesses of each view, and begin to articulate your own view of important environmental issues.<br>

<h3><strong><u>COURSE OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>1. Gaining factual knowledge and fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories--This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3><br>
  2. Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions)--This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, classÂ participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3><br>

<h3><strong><u>COURSE STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>The course will be divided into three parts. It will begin with an overview of the basic concepts involved in environmental ethics, including a review of the main Western and Eastern ethical theories (about 3 weeks). The second part will focus on alternative theories of environmental ethics, including bio-centric ethics, holism, the land ethic, deep ecology, eco-feminism, and justice and social ecology (about 6 weeks). The third part will focus environmental ethics as a form of applied ethics and consider practical applications of the various theories to important questions related to global climate change, endangered species, sustainability, industrial farming, animal rights, synthetic biology, wilderness and land management, environmental activism, eco-terrorism, environmental refugees, carbon mitigation, and our duties to future generations (about 5 weeks).</h3>
<h3>Readings will include primary and secondary sources related to the topics considered throughout the course. Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a final paper (or a midterm and final exam). Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>REQUIRED TEXTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Desjardins, Joseph, <u>Environmental Ethics</u> (5th Edition)<br>
  SELECTED HANDOUTS<br>
  SELECTED ON-LINE TEXTS</h3>
<h3><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. Students will be assigned weekly readings from the course text. They will be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to presentations about the readings. Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a final paper (or a midterm and final exam).</h3>
<h3>The course will begin with a lecture format--for two weeks only. It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for four areas of activity: <br>
  1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion Leading, and 4) a Final Paper or Midterm and Final Exam.</h3>
<h3><strong>1) PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the class. Students <u>MUST</u> post at least one reaction to the readings each week.</h3>
<h3><strong>2) WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion Area postings for the week. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale. &quot;1&quot; is missing or deficient (D-F). &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A). Students responsible for Discussion Leading will be responsible for significant Web postings--i.e., questions related to the readings and topics to be discussed in class.</h3>
<h3><strong>3) DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of selecting 3 topics/readings (by WEEK #3), meeting with Dr. Laumakis to discuss your choice (at least one week before your topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion on the Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion during the class you present the issues involved in your selections. Students must select one reading from the theories of environmental ethics (Chapters 6-11), one reading from environmental ethics as applied ethics (Chapters 3-5), and one reading related to a particular practical application. For the last exercise, students may work in teams of two.</h3>
<h3><strong>4) THE FINAL PAPER</strong> consists of either a synthesis of your Weekly Reaction Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treated in them or an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topic or theme treated in the course. The Midterm and Final would be specified at a later date.</h3>
<h3><strong>5)</strong> <u> <strong>NOTE</strong></u>: <strong>Late papers will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late. Finally, for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.</strong></h3>
