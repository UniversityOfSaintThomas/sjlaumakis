<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>From ancient texts to the present day, writers have been interested in the intersection of nature and spirituality. This seminar looks at works from Eastern (Buddhism, Daoism) and Western (primarily Christian) traditions and compares and contrasts them.</h3>
<h3>Some of the earliest spiritual or ethical writing known to our culture comes from or refers to nature; several Hebrew Testament prophets, for example, use nature and its destruction as a metaphor for the consequences of sin. More recently, American writer Aldo Leopold, in 1949, introduced what he termed a &ldquo;land ethic&rdquo; in which he develops the idea of an ecosystem based on ethical or moral values. Similarly, in Daoism, nature and man are (or should be) a harmonious whole. The Bodhisattva (=future Buddha) found enlightenment under a bodhi tree in India and spent seven weeks meditating under it to attain the status of a fully realized Buddha.</h3>
<h3>The seminar will focus on what American nature writer John Burroughs referred to as &ldquo;the ramble,&rdquo; in which the writer sets out to find the meaning of nature in his or her neighborhood. Burroughs Medal winner Sigurd Olson, for example, pinned a Bible verse on his Duluth pack to contemplate while he paddled across the canoe country wilderness near his Ely home.</h3>
<h3>Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, reaction papers, and in-class discussion leading. </h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>1. Gaining a basic understanding of the subject (i.e., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories).&nbsp;<br>
  * This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation and&nbsp;discussion leading.&nbsp;<br>
  2. To acquire skills in working with others as a member of a team.&nbsp;<br>
  * This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.&nbsp;<br>
  3. Developing skill in expressing oneself orally and in writing. <br>
  * This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.&nbsp;<br>
  4. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.&nbsp;<br>
  * This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly four parts.</h3>
<h3><br>
  The first part will be concerned with practical matters, and background on Western and Eastern views of nature and spirituality. Initial classroom presentations by the professors--in the first part--will lay the groundwork for students to discover and develop their own presentations about nature and spirituality--in the second through fourth parts. Discussions, based on the texts of the seminar, will strengthen their analytic skills and their knowledge of issues related to nature and spirituality.</h3>
<h3>The second part will focus on Eastern texts on nature and spirituality.</h3>
<h3>The third part will focus on Western/Christian texts on nature and spirituality.</h3>
<h3>The fourth part of the seminar will focus on comparing and contrasting the Eastern and<br>
  Western texts studied in the course.</h3>
<h3>We will also introduce the students to some basic Buddhist and Christian meditative techniques and ask them to engage in &ldquo;walking&rdquo; meditations in nature.  We will ask the students to write about their experiences on these &ldquo;walks,&rdquo; similar to the rambles of John Burroughs.</h3>
<h3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in on-line <br>
  discussions of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings. Students are expected to devote about 3-4 hours of study each week to this seminar.</h3>
<h3>We realize that we live in the age of social media and constant connectivity. A seminar style, however, relies on effective communication skills from all involved. That means not only effectively presenting your ideas, but also listening attentively to others. To listen effectively you need to disconnect from e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, web surfing and other digital distractions during class time. If you bring a laptop or tablet to class it should be used only for class-related activities.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>TEXTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Barnhill, D. and Gottlieb, R. eds. (2001) <u>Deep Ecology and World Religions</u><br>
  Bryson, Bill. (2006) <u>A Walk in the Woods</u><br>
  Wohlleben, Peter (2016) <u>The Hidden Life of Trees</u></h3>
<h3><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks, at most) as we present an overview of Eastern and Western approaches to nature and spirituality. It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h3>
<h3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Leading Discussion.</h3>
<h3>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar. It is critical that you read, reflect, and come ready to discuss. Participation will also be possible through MINDFULNESS BLOGS. Mindfulness is all about first-person observation, and engaging in an all-encompassing awareness of what's going on around you. We want you to seek out opportunities to be mindful, or to reflect on mindfulness (outside of just thinking about the reading). Try to experience mindful states while out in nature, and then report on your own experience, and respond to the posts of others. What do you see? What do you hear? How do you experience mindful states in nature? Turn off your cell phone for an hour. Don't log in to Facebook for a day; just sit and reflect. What do you experience? And of course, respond to the posts of others; we want these to be ongoing conversations. Everyone should be active in both class discussions and blog discussions. Active engagement (consistent and substantive contributions just about every week) in both will be necessary for an &quot;A&quot; on this component. </h3>
<h3>2)<strong> REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-to-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on pre-assigned readings. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale. &ldquo;1&ldquo; is missing or deficient (D-F). &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).</h3>
<h3>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 2-to-3 students (by WEEK #2-3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2-3), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic. Students will be responsible for leading discussion two times.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>ATTENDANCE POLICY</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Please turn off your cell phones!</h3>
<h3><strong><u>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Participation/Web = 40%<br>
  Reaction Papers = 35%<br>
  Discussion Leading = 15%<br>
  Additional 10% (Add in where you want!)<br>
  </h3>
<h3><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This is an Honors Seminar—Students will be graded accordingly! </h3>
