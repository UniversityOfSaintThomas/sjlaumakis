<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>This seminar will explore attempts by psychologists and Buddhists to understand consciousness.
The course will be organized topically, focusing on both Western philosophical and psychological accounts 
of consciousness and Buddhist theory and practice. </h3>
<h3>The views to be considered include:recent work by cognitive psychologists, cognitive scientists, 
  and the teachings of the Buddha as they have been interpreted by his Theravada, Mahayana, and Tibetan followers. Readings will
include primary and secondary sources from each discipline. Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, 
  short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading.</h3>
  <h3>
<h3>The notion of consciousness--our awareness of the internal and external world--
has always been a topic of intense interest to philosophers and scientists, both 
Eastern and Western. The Western approach has tended to rely on the
scientific method, using empirical investigations and objective inquiry to specify
he nature of consciousness. A recent approach to understanding the nature of
consciousness and thought (which has emerged and gained prominence over the 
past 75 years) is termed cognitive science.  Cognitive science represents an
interdisciplinary attempt to understand the nature of thinking, and is rooted
primarily in the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology, neuroscience,
artificial intelligence, linguistics, and anthropology.  Perhaps the most lively
interaction among these disciplines lies at the crossroads of the first three--
philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology (more specifically, cognitive
psychology).  In fact, much current work in cognitive science is focused on
trying to respond to basic philosophical questions about psychological processes
(e.g., What is the nature of consciousness?) with the tools of brain science (e.g.
brain imaging techniques such as PET scanning).</h3>
    <h3>
<h3>Eastern approaches (Buddhism, in particular) are also devoted to investigating 
and understanding consciousness. However, their focus is on the analysis of
subjective experience through meditative practice, and the cultivation of
mindfulness—being awake and fully aware. Buddhists are especially concerned
with the practical and moral consequences of this meditative practice. This
subjective and contemplative approach to analyzing consciousness can be seen in
Western approaches in the form of analytic introspection (a popular tool for
analyzing consciousness early in the development of psychology), but was largely
abandoned as unscientific. Recently, however, the phenomenological aspects of
cognition and consciousness have made a comeback, and there has been an 
important meeting of Eastern and Western minds with regard to the analysis of
consciousness. Both traditions are investigating the benefits of meditation for
psychological and physical well-being, as well as what the meditative state tells
us about the nature of consciousness and thought. </h3>

<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>1. Gaining a basic understanding of the subject (i.e., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories).<br>
  *This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>2. To acquire skills in working with others as a member of a team.<br>
  *This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>3. Developing skill in expressing oneself orally and in writing. </h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>4. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.<br>
  *This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.<br>
  </h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly two parts. </h3>
<h3>Initial classroom presentations by the professors--in the first part--will lay the groundwork for students to discover and develop their own presentations about philosophical and legal issues related to sports--in the second part.&nbsp; Discussions, based on the Spengler and Simon texts and the Journal of the Philosophy of Sport, will strengthen their analytic skills and their knowledge of philosophical and legal matters related to sports.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line <br>
  discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week (10 total). Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings. Students are expected to devote about 3-4 hours of study each week to this seminar.</h3>
<h3>We realize that we live in the age of social media and constant connectivity. A seminar style, however, relies on effective communication skills from all involved. That means not only effectively presenting your ideas, but also listening attentively to others. To listen effectively you need to disconnect from e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, web surfing and other digital distractions during class time. If you bring a laptop or tablet to class it should be used only for class related activities.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>TEXTS</u></strong>:</h3>
  <h3>Dalai Lama,&nbsp;<u>Where Buddhism Meets Neuroscience</u></h3>
  <h3>Goleman, Daniel and Davidson, Richard. <u>Altered Traits</u></h3>
  <h3>Hanh, Thich Nhat.<u>The Miracle of Mindfulness</u></h3>
<h3><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two-four weeks--at most) as we present an overview of the philosophical and legal issues related to each aspect of sports. It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h3>
<h3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.</h3>
<h3>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Canvas Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.</h3>
<h3>2)<strong> REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on pre-assigned readings. These seven (7) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale. "0/1" is missing or deficient (D-F). "3" is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). "5" is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).</h3>
<h3>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2-3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2-3), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic. Students will be responsible for leading discussion two times.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>ATTENDANCE POLICY</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones!</h3>
<h3><u>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/AI POLICY:</u></h3>
<h3>First, DON'T DO IT! You don't need it and it won't help! Second, first use and caught gets you a zero for the assignment.</h3>
<h3>Third, second use gets you a zero/F for the class. So, Don't use it! You don't need it and it won't help!</h3>
  
<h3><strong><u>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Participation/Web = 40%<br>
  Weekly Reaction Papers = 40%<br>
  Discussion Leading = 20%<br> </h3>
<h3><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This is an Honors Seminar--Students will be graded accordingly!</h3>
