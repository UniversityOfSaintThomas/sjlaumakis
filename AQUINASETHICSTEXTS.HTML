<h1>AQUINAS TEXTS 1</h1>
<h1>ST, I-II, Q. 18, a. 1-4 </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 1 Whether every human action is good, or are there evil actions?</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that every human action is good, and that
  none is evil. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that evil acts not, save
  in virtue of the good. But no evil is done in virtue of the good. Therefore
no action is evil. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, nothing acts except in so far as it is in act.
  Now a thing is evil, not according as it is in act, but according as its
  potentiality is void of act; whereas in so far as its potentiality is perfected
  by act, it is good, as stated in Metaph. ix, 9. Therefore nothing acts in
  so far as it is evil, but only according as it is good. Therefore every
action is good, and none is evil. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, evil cannot be a cause, save accidentally, as
  Dionysius declares (Div. Nom. iv). But every action has some effect which
  is proper to it. Therefore no action is evil, but every action is good.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, Our Lord said (Jn. 3:20): &quot;Every one that doth
  evil, hateth the light.&quot; Therefore some actions of man are evil. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, We must speak of good and evil in actions as of good
  and evil in things: because such as everything is, such is the act that
  it produces. Now in things, each one has so much good as it has being: since
  good and being are convertible, as was stated in the I, 5, 1,3. But God
  alone has the whole plenitude of His Being in a certain unity: whereas every
  other thing has its proper fullness of being in a certain multiplicity.
  Wherefore it happens with some things, that they have being in some respect,
  and yet they are lacking in the fullness of being due to them. Thus the
  fullness of human being requires a compound of soul and body, having all
  the powers and instruments of knowledge and movement: wherefore if any man
  be lacking in any of these, he is lacking in something due to the fullness
  of his being. So that as much as he has of being, so much has he of goodness:
  while so far as he is lacking in goodness, and is said to be evil: thus
  a blind man is possessed of goodness inasmuch as he lives; and of evil,
  inasmuch as he lacks sight. That, however, which has nothing of being or
  goodness, could not be said to be either evil or good. But since this same
  fullness of being is of the very essence of good, if a thing be lacking
  in its due fullness of being, it is not said to be good simply, but in a
  certain respect, inasmuch as it is a being; although it can be called a
  being simply, and a non-being in a certain respect, as was stated in the
  I, 5, 1, ad 1. We must therefore say that every action has goodness, in
  so far as it has being; whereas it is lacking in goodness, in so far as
  it is lacking in something that is due to its fullness of being; and thus
  it is said to be evil: for instance if it lacks the quantity determined
by reason, or its due place, or something of the kind. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. Evil acts in virtue of deficient goodness. For
  if there were nothing of good there, there would be neither being nor possibility
  of action. On the other hand if good were not deficient, there would be
  no evil. Consequently the action done is a deficient good, which is good
in a certain respect, but simply evil. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. Nothing hinders a thing from being in act in a
  certain respect, so that it can act; and in a certain respect deficient
  in act, so as to cause a deficient act. Thus a blind man has in act the
  power of walking, whereby he is able to walk; but inasmuch as he is deprived
of sight he suffers a defect in walking by stumbling when he walks. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. An evil action can have a proper effect, according
  to the goodness and being that it has. Thus adultery is the cause of human
  generation, inasmuch as it implies union of male and female, but not inasmuch
as it lacks the order of reason. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 2 Whether the good or evil of a man's action is derived from its
  object? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the good or evil of an action is not
  derived from its object. For the object of any action is a thing. But &quot;evil
  is not in things, but in the sinner's use of them,&quot; as Augustine says
  (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12). Therefore the good or evil of a human action
is not derived from their object. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the object is compared to the action as its matter.
  But the goodness of a thing is not from its matter, but rather from the
  form, which is an act. Therefore good and evil in actions is not derived
from their object. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, the object of an active power is compared to the
  action as effect to cause. But the goodness of a cause does not depend on
  its effect; rather is it the reverse. Therefore good or evil in actions
is not derived from their object. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, It is written (Osee 9:10): &quot;They became abominable
  as those things which they loved.&quot; Now man becomes abominable to God
  on account of the malice of his action. Therefore the malice of his action
  is according to the evil objects that man loves. And the same applies to
the goodness of his action. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, as stated above (1) the good or evil of an action, as
  of other things, depends on its fullness of being or its lack of that fullness.
  Now the first thing that belongs to the fullness of being seems to be that
  which gives a thing its species. And just as a natural thing has its species
  from its form, so an action has its species from its object, as movement
  from its term. And therefore just as the primary goodness of a natural thing
  is derived from its form, which gives it its species, so the primary goodness
  of a moral action is derived from its suitable object: hence some call such
  an action &quot;good in its genus&quot;; for instance, &quot;to make use
  of what is one's own.&quot; And just as, in natural things, the primary
  evil is when a generated thing does not realize its specific form (for instance,
  if instead of a man, something else be generated); so the primary evil in
  moral actions is that which is from the object, for instance, &quot;to take
  what belongs to another.&quot; And this action is said to be &quot;evil
  in its genus,&quot; genus here standing for species, just as we apply the
term &quot;mankind&quot; to the whole human species. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. Although external things are good in themselves,
  nevertheless they have not always a due proportion to this or that action.
  And so, inasmuch as they are considered as objects of such actions, they
have not the quality of goodness. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. The object is not the matter &quot;of which&quot;
  (a thing is made), but the matter &quot;about which&quot; (something is
  done); and stands in relation to the act as its form, as it were, through
giving it its species. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. The object of the human action is not always the
  object of an active power. For the appetitive power is, in a way, passive;
  in so far as it is moved by the appetible object; and yet it is a principle
  of human actions. Nor again have the objects of the active powers always
  the nature of an effect, but only when they are already transformed: thus
  food when transformed is the effect of the nutritive power; whereas food
  before being transformed stands in relation to the nutritive power as the
  matter about which it exercises its operation. Now since the object is in
  some way the effect of the active power, it follows that it is the term
  of its action, and consequently that it gives it its form and species, since
  movement derives its species from its term. Moreover, although the goodness
  of an action is not caused by the goodness of its effect, yet an action
  is said to be good from the fact that it can produce a good effect. Consequently
  the very proportion of an action to its effect is the measure of its goodness.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 3 Whether man's action is good or evil from a circumstance? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that an action is not good or evil from a
  circumstance. For circumstances stand around [circumstant] an action, as
  being outside it, as stated above (7, 1). But &quot;good and evil are in
  things themselves,&quot; as is stated in Metaph. vi, 4. Therefore an action
does not derive goodness or malice from a circumstance. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the goodness or malice of an action is considered
  principally in the doctrine of morals. But since circumstances are accidents
  of actions, it seems that they are outside the scope of art: because &quot;no
  art takes notice of what is accidental&quot; (Metaph. vi, 2). Therefore
the goodness or malice of an action is not taken from a circumstance. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, that which belongs to a thing, in respect of its
  substance, is not ascribed to it in respect of an accident. But good and
  evil belong to an action in respect of its substance; because an action
  can be good or evil in its genus as stated above (2). Therefore an action
is not good or bad from a circumstance. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3) that a virtuous
  man acts as he should, and when he should, and so on in respect of the other
  circumstances. Therefore, on the other hand, the vicious man, in the matter
  of each vice, acts when he should not, or where he should not, and so on
  with the other circumstances. Therefore human actions are good or evil according
to circumstances. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, In natural things, it is to be noted that the whole fullness
  of perfection due to a thing, is not from the mere substantial form, that
  gives it its species; since a thing derives much from supervening accidents,
  as man does from shape, color, and the like; and if any one of these accidents
  be out of due proportion, evil is the result. So it is with action. For
  the plenitude of its goodness does not consist wholly in its species, but
  also in certain additions which accrue to it by reason of certain accidents:
  and such are its due circumstances. Wherefore if something be wanting that
is requisite as a due circumstance the action will be evil. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. Circumstances are outside an action, inasmuch
  as they are not part of its essence; but they are in an action as accidents
  thereof. Thus, too, accidents in natural substances are outside the essence.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. Every accident is not accidentally in its subject;
  for some are proper accidents; and of these every art takes notice. And
  thus it is that the circumstances of actions are considered in the doctrine
of morals. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. Since good and being are convertible; according
  as being is predicated of substance and of accident, so is good predicated
  of a thing both in respect of its essential being, and in respect of its
  accidental being; and this, both in natural things and in moral actions.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 4 Whether a human action is good or evil from its end? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the good and evil in human actions are
  not from the end. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that &quot;nothing acts
  with a view to evil.&quot; If therefore an action were good or evil from
its end, no action would be evil. Which is clearly false. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the goodness of an action is something in the
  action. But the end is an extrinsic cause. Therefore an action is not said
to be good or bad according to its end. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, a good action may happen to be ordained to an
  evil end, as when a man gives alms from vainglory; and conversely, an evil
  action may happen to be ordained to a good end, as a theft committed in
  order to give something to the poor. Therefore an action is not good or
evil from its end. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, Boethius says (De Differ. Topic. ii) that &quot;if
  the end is good, the thing is good, and if the end be evil, the thing also
is evil.&quot; </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, The disposition of things as to goodness is the same
  as their disposition as to being. Now in some things the being does not
  depend on another, and in these it suffices to consider their being absolutely.
  But there are things the being of which depends on something else, and hence
  in their regard we must consider their being in its relation to the cause
  on which it depends. Now just as the being of a thing depends on the agent,
  and the form, so the goodness of a thing depends on its end. Hence in the
  Divine Persons, Whose goodness does not depend on another, the measure of
  goodness is not taken from the end. Whereas human actions, and other things,
  the goodness of which depends on something else, have a measure of goodness
  from the end on which they depend, besides that goodness which is in them
absolutely. </h1>
<h1>Accordingly a fourfold goodness may be considered in a human action.
  First, that which, as an action, it derives from its genus; because as much
  as it has of action and being so much has it of goodness, as stated above
  (1). Secondly, it has goodness according to its species; which is derived
  from its suitable object. Thirdly, it has goodness from its circumstances,
  in respect, as it were, of its accidents. Fourthly, it has goodness from
its end, to which it is compared as to the cause of its goodness. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. The good in view of which one acts is not always
  a true good; but sometimes it is a true good, sometimes an apparent good.
And in the latter event, an evil action results from the end in view. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. Although the end is an extrinsic cause, nevertheless
  due proportion to the end, and relation to the end, are inherent to the
action. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. Nothing hinders an action that is good in one
  of the way mentioned above, from lacking goodness in another way. And thus
  it may happen that an action which is good in its species or in its circumstances
  is ordained to an evil end, or vice versa. However, an action is not good
  simply, unless it is good in all those ways: since &quot;evil results from
  any single defect, but good from the complete cause,&quot; as Dionysius
says (Div. Nom. iv). </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>AQUINAS TEXTS 2 </h1>
<h1>ST, I-II, Q. 94, a. 2, 4-6 </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 2 Whether the natural law contains several precepts, or only one?</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the natural law contains, not several
  precepts, but one only. For law is a kind of precept, as stated above (92,
  2). If therefore there were many precepts of the natural law, it would follow
that there are also many natural laws. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the natural law is consequent to human nature.
  But human nature, as a whole, is one; though, as to its parts, it is manifold.
  Therefore, either there is but one precept of the law of nature, on account
  of the unity of nature as a whole; or there are many, by reason of the number
  of parts of human nature. The result would be that even things relating
  to the inclination of the concupiscible faculty belong to the natural law.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, law is something pertaining to reason, as stated
  above (90, 1). Now reason is but one in man. Therefore there is only one
precept of the natural law. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, The precepts of the natural law in man stand in relation
  to practical matters, as the first principles to matters of demonstration.
  But there are several first indemonstrable principles. Therefore there are
also several precepts of the natural law. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, As stated above (91, 3), the precepts of the natural
  law are to the practical reason, what the first principles of demonstrations
  are to the speculative reason; because both are self-evident principles.
  Now a thing is said to be self-evident in two ways: first, in itself; secondly,
  in relation to us. Any proposition is said to be self-evident in itself,
  if its predicate is contained in the notion of the subject: although, to
  one who knows not the definition of the subject, it happens that such a
  proposition is not self-evident. For instance, this proposition, &quot;Man
  is a rational being,&quot; is, in its very nature, self-evident, since who
  says &quot;man,&quot; says &quot;a rational being&quot;: and yet to one
  who knows not what a man is, this proposition is not self-evident. Hence
  it is that, as Boethius says (De Hebdom.), certain axioms or propositions
  are universally self-evident to all; and such are those propositions whose
  terms are known to all, as, &quot;Every whole is greater than its part,&quot;
  and, &quot;Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.&quot;
  But some propositions are self-evident only to the wise, who understand
  the meaning of the terms of such propositions: thus to one who understands
  that an angel is not a body, it is self-evident that an angel is not circumscriptively
  in a place: but this is not evident to the unlearned, for they cannot grasp
it. </h1>
<h1>Now a certain order is to be found in those things that are apprehended
  universally. For that which, before aught else, falls under apprehension,
  is &quot;being,&quot; the notion of which is included in all things whatsoever
  a man apprehends. Wherefore the first indemonstrable principle is that &quot;the
  same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time,&quot; which is
  based on the notion of &quot;being&quot; and &quot;not-being&quot;: and
  on this principle all others are based, as is stated in Metaph. iv, text.
  9. Now as &quot;being&quot; is the first thing that falls under the apprehension
  simply, so &quot;good&quot; is the first thing that falls under the apprehension
  of the practical reason, which is directed to action: since every agent
  acts for an end under the aspect of good. Consequently the first principle
  of practical reason is one founded on the notion of good, viz. that &quot;good
  is that which all things seek after.&quot; Hence this is the first precept
  of law, that &quot;good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided.&quot;
  All other precepts of the natural law are based upon this: so that whatever
  the practical reason naturally apprehends as man's good (or evil) belongs
to the precepts of the natural law as something to be done or avoided. </h1>
<h1>Since, however, good has the nature of an end, and evil, the nature
  of a contrary, hence it is that all those things to which man has a natural
  inclination, are naturally apprehended by reason as being good, and consequently
  as objects of pursuit, and their contraries as evil, and objects of avoidance.
  Wherefore according to the order of natural inclinations, is the order of
  the precepts of the natural law. Because in man there is first of all an
  inclination to good in accordance with the nature which he has in common
  with all substances: inasmuch as every substance seeks the preservation
  of its own being, according to its nature: and by reason of this inclination,
  whatever is a means of preserving human life, and of warding off its obstacles,
  belongs to the natural law. Secondly, there is in man an inclination to
  things that pertain to him more specially, according to that nature which
  he has in common with other animals: and in virtue of this inclination,
  those things are said to belong to the natural law, &quot;which nature has
  taught to all animals&quot; [Pandect. Just. I, tit. i], such as sexual intercourse,
  education of offspring and so forth. Thirdly, there is in man an inclination
  to good, according to the nature of his reason, which nature is proper to
  him: thus man has a natural inclination to know the truth about God, and
  to live in society: and in this respect, whatever pertains to this inclination
  belongs to the natural law; for instance, to shun ignorance, to avoid offending
  those among whom one has to live, and other such things regarding the above
inclination. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. All these precepts of the law of nature have the
  character of one natural law, inasmuch as they flow from one first precept.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. All the inclinations of any parts whatsoever of
  human nature, e.g. of the concupiscible and irascible parts, in so far as
  they are ruled by reason, belong to the natural law, and are reduced to
  one first precept, as stated above: so that the precepts of the natural
law are many in themselves, but are based on one common foundation. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. Although reason is one in itself, yet it directs
  all things regarding man; so that whatever can be ruled by reason, is contained
under the law of reason. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 4 Whether the natural law is the same in all men? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the natural law is not the same in all.
  For it is stated in the Decretals (Dist. i) that &quot;the natural law is
  that which is contained in the Law and the Gospel.&quot; But this is not
  common to all men; because, as it is written (Rm. 10:16), &quot;all do not
  obey the gospel.&quot; Therefore the natural law is not the same in all
men. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, &quot;Things which are according to the law are
  said to be just,&quot; as stated in Ethic. v. But it is stated in the same
  book that nothing is so universally just as not to be subject to change
  in regard to some men. Therefore even the natural law is not the same in
all men. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, as stated above (2,3), to the natural law belongs
  everything to which a man is inclined according to his nature. Now different
  men are naturally inclined to different things; some to the desire of pleasures,
  others to the desire of honors, and other men to other things. Therefore
there is not one natural law for all. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, Isidore says (Etym. v, 4): &quot;The natural law is
  common to all nations.&quot; </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, As stated above (2,3), to the natural law belongs those
  things to which a man is inclined naturally: and among these it is proper
  to man to be inclined to act according to reason. Now the process of reason
  is from the common to the proper, as stated in Phys. i. The speculative
  reason, however, is differently situated in this matter, from the practical
  reason. For, since the speculative reason is busied chiefly with the necessary
  things, which cannot be otherwise than they are, its proper conclusions,
  like the universal principles, contain the truth without fail. The practical
  reason, on the other hand, is busied with contingent matters, about which
  human actions are concerned: and consequently, although there is necessity
  in the general principles, the more we descend to matters of detail, the
  more frequently we encounter defects. Accordingly then in speculative matters
  truth is the same in all men, both as to principles and as to conclusions:
  although the truth is not known to all as regards the conclusions, but only
  as regards the principles which are called common notions. But in matters
  of action, truth or practical rectitude is not the same for all, as to matters
  of detail, but only as to the general principles: and where there is the
same rectitude in matters of detail, it is not equally known to all. </h1>
<h1>It is therefore evident that, as regards the general principles whether
  of speculative or of practical reason, truth or rectitude is the same for
  all, and is equally known by all. As to the proper conclusions of the speculative
  reason, the truth is the same for all, but is not equally known to all:
  thus it is true for all that the three angles of a triangle are together
  equal to two right angles, although it is not known to all. But as to the
  proper conclusions of the practical reason, neither is the truth or rectitude
  the same for all, nor, where it is the same, is it equally known by all.
  Thus it is right and true for all to act according to reason: and from this
  principle it follows as a proper conclusion, that goods entrusted to another
  should be restored to their owner. Now this is true for the majority of
  cases: but it may happen in a particular case that it would be injurious,
  and therefore unreasonable, to restore goods held in trust; for instance,
  if they are claimed for the purpose of fighting against one's country. And
  this principle will be found to fail the more, according as we descend further
  into detail, e.g. if one were to say that goods held in trust should be
  restored with such and such a guarantee, or in such and such a way; because
  the greater the number of conditions added, the greater the number of ways
  in which the principle may fail, so that it be not right to restore or not
to restore. </h1>
<h1>Consequently we must say that the natural law, as to general principles,
  is the same for all, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge. But as to
  certain matters of detail, which are conclusions, as it were, of those general
  principles, it is the same for all in the majority of cases, both as to
  rectitude and as to knowledge; and yet in some few cases it may fail, both
  as to rectitude, by reason of certain obstacles (just as natures subject
  to generation and corruption fail in some few cases on account of some obstacle),
  and as to knowledge, since in some the reason is perverted by passion, or
  evil habit, or an evil disposition of nature; thus formerly, theft, although
  it is expressly contrary to the natural law, was not considered wrong among
the Germans, as Julius Caesar relates (De Bello Gall. vi). </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. The meaning of the sentence quoted is not that
  whatever is contained in the Law and the Gospel belongs to the natural law,
  since they contain many things that are above nature; but that whatever
  belongs to the natural law is fully contained in them. Wherefore Gratian,
  after saying that &quot;the natural law is what is contained in the Law
  and the Gospel,&quot; adds at once, by way of example, &quot;by which everyone
is commanded to do to others as he would be done by.&quot; </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. The saying of the Philosopher is to be understood
  of things that are naturally just, not as general principles, but as conclusions
  drawn from them, having rectitude in the majority of cases, but failing
in a few. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. As, in man, reason rules and commands the other
  powers, so all the natural inclinations belonging to the other powers must
  needs be directed according to reason. Wherefore it is universally right
  for all men, that all their inclinations should be directed according to
reason. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 5 Whether the natural law can be changed? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the natural law can be changed. Because
  on Sirach 17:9, &quot;He gave them instructions, and the law of life,&quot;
  the gloss says: &quot;He wished the law of the letter to be written, in
  order to correct the law of nature.&quot; But that which is corrected is
changed. Therefore the natural law can be changed. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the slaying of the innocent, adultery, and theft
  are against the natural law. But we find these things changed by God: as
  when God commanded Abraham to slay his innocent son (Gn. 22:2); and when
  he ordered the Jews to borrow and purloin the vessels of the Egyptians (Ex.
  12:35); and when He commanded Osee to take to himself &quot;a wife of fornications&quot;
(Osee 1:2). Therefore the natural law can be changed. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, Isidore says (Etym. 5:4) that &quot;the possession
  of all things in common, and universal freedom, are matters of natural law.&quot;
  But these things are seen to be changed by human laws. Therefore it seems
that the natural law is subject to change. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, It is said in the Decretals (Dist. v): &quot;The natural
  law dates from the creation of the rational creature. It does not vary according
to time, but remains unchangeable.&quot; </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, A change in the natural law may be understood in two
  ways. First, by way of addition. In this sense nothing hinders the natural
  law from being changed: since many things for the benefit of human life
  have been added over and above the natural law, both by the Divine law and
by human laws. </h1>
<h1>Secondly, a change in the natural law may be understood by way of subtraction,
  so that what previously was according to the natural law, ceases to be so.
  In this sense, the natural law is altogether unchangeable in its first principles:
  but in its secondary principles, which, as we have said (4), are certain
  detailed proximate conclusions drawn from the first principles, the natural
  law is not changed so that what it prescribes be not right in most cases.
  But it may be changed in some particular cases of rare occurrence, through
  some special causes hindering the observance of such precepts, as stated
above (4). </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. The written law is said to be given for the correction
  of the natural law, either because it supplies what was wanting to the natural
  law; or because the natural law was perverted in the hearts of some men,
  as to certain matters, so that they esteemed those things good which are
naturally evil; which perversion stood in need of correction. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. All men alike, both guilty and innocent, die the
  death of nature: which death of nature is inflicted by the power of God
  on account of original sin, according to 1 Kgs. 2:6: &quot;The Lord killeth
  and maketh alive.&quot; Consequently, by the command of God, death can be
  inflicted on any man, guilty or innocent, without any injustice whatever.
  In like manner adultery is intercourse with another's wife; who is allotted
  to him by the law emanating from God. Consequently intercourse with any
  woman, by the command of God, is neither adultery nor fornication. The same
  applies to theft, which is the taking of another's property. For whatever
  is taken by the command of God, to Whom all things belong, is not taken
  against the will of its owner, whereas it is in this that theft consists.
  Nor is it only in human things, that whatever is commanded by God is right;
  but also in natural things, whatever is done by God, is, in some way, natural,
as stated in the I, 105, 6, ad 1. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. A thing is said to belong to the natural law in
  two ways. First, because nature inclines thereto: e.g. that one should not
  do harm to another. Secondly, because nature did not bring in the contrary:
  thus we might say that for man to be naked is of the natural law, because
  nature did not give him clothes, but art invented them. In this sense, &quot;the
  possession of all things in common and universal freedom&quot; are said
  to be of the natural law, because, to wit, the distinction of possessions
  and slavery were not brought in by nature, but devised by human reason for
  the benefit of human life. Accordingly the law of nature was not changed
in this respect, except by addition. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 6 Whether the law of nature can be abolished from the heart of man?</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that the natural law can be abolished from
  the heart of man. Because on Rm. 2:14, &quot;When the Gentiles who have
  not the law,&quot; etc. a gloss says that &quot;the law of righteousness,
  which sin had blotted out, is graven on the heart of man when he is restored
  by grace.&quot; But the law of righteousness is the law of nature. Therefore
the law of nature can be blotted out. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, the law of grace is more efficacious than the
  law of nature. But the law of grace is blotted out by sin. Much more therefore
can the law of nature be blotted out. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, that which is established by law is made just.
  But many things are enacted by men, which are contrary to the law of nature.
Therefore the law of nature can be abolished from the heart of man. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, Augustine says (Confess. ii): &quot;Thy law is written
  in the hearts of men, which iniquity itself effaces not.&quot; But the law
  which is written in men's hearts is the natural law. Therefore the natural
law cannot be blotted out. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, As stated above (4,5), there belong to the natural law,
  first, certain most general precepts, that are known to all; and secondly,
  certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were, conclusions
  following closely from first principles. As to those general principles,
  the natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be blotted out from men's hearts.
  But it is blotted out in the case of a particular action, in so far as reason
  is hindered from applying the general principle to a particular point of
  practice, on account of concupiscence or some other passion, as stated above
  (77, 2). But as to the other, i.e. the secondary precepts, the natural law
  can be blotted out from the human heart, either by evil persuasions, just
  as in speculative matters errors occur in respect of necessary conclusions;
  or by vicious customs and corrupt habits, as among some men, theft, and
  even unnatural vices, as the Apostle states (Rm. i), were not esteemed sinful.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. Sin blots out the law of nature in particular
  cases, not universally, except perchance in regard to the secondary precepts
of the natural law, in the way stated above. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 2. Although grace is more efficacious than nature,
  yet nature is more essential to man, and therefore more enduring. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. This argument is true of the secondary precepts
  of the natural law, against which some legislators have framed certain enactments
which are unjust. 	   </h1>

<h1> AQUINAS TEXTS 3 </h1>
<h1>ST, II-II, Q. 64, a. 7 </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>a. 7 Whether it is lawful to kill a man in self-defense? </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 1. It would seem that nobody may lawfully kill a man in self-defense.
  For Augustine says to Publicola (Ep. xlvii): &quot;I do not agree with the
  opinion that one may kill a man lest one be killed by him; unless one be
  a soldier, exercise a public office, so that one does it not for oneself
  but for others, having the power to do so, provided it be in keeping with
  one's person.&quot; Now he who kills a man in self-defense, kills him lest
he be killed by him. Therefore this would seem to be unlawful. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 2. Further, he says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): &quot;How are they
  free from sin in sight of Divine providence, who are guilty of taking a
  man's life for the sake of these contemptible things?&quot; Now among contemptible
  things he reckons &quot;those which men may forfeit unwillingly,&quot; as
  appears from the context (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): and the chief of these is
  the life of the body. Therefore it is unlawful for any man to take another's
life for the sake of the life of his own body. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 3. Further, Pope Nicolas [Nicolas I, Dist. 1, can. De his
  clericis] says in the Decretals: &quot;Concerning the clerics about whom
  you have consulted Us, those, namely, who have killed a pagan in self-defense,
  as to whether, after making amends by repenting, they may return to their
  former state, or rise to a higher degree; know that in no case is it lawful
  for them to kill any man under any circumstances whatever.&quot; Now clerics
  and laymen are alike bound to observe the moral precepts. Therefore neither
is it lawful for laymen to kill anyone in self-defense. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 4. Further, murder is a more grievous sin than fornication
  or adultery. Now nobody may lawfully commit simple fornication or adultery
  or any other mortal sin in order to save his own life; since the spiritual
  life is to be preferred to the life of the body. Therefore no man may lawfully
take another's life in self-defense in order to save his own life. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Objection 5. Further, if the tree be evil, so is the fruit, according
  to Mt. 7:17. Now self-defense itself seems to be unlawful, according to
  Rm. 12:19: &quot;Not defending [Douay: 'revenging'] yourselves, my dearly
  beloved.&quot; Therefore its result, which is the slaying of a man, is also
unlawful. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>On the contrary, It is written (Ex. 22:2): &quot;If a thief be found
  breaking into a house or undermining it, and be wounded so as to die; he
  that slew him shall not be guilty of blood.&quot; Now it is much more lawful
  to defend one's life than one's house. Therefore neither is a man guilty
of murder if he kill another in defense of his own life. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>I answer that, Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only
  one of which is intended, while the other is beside the intention. Now moral
  acts take their species according to what is intended, and not according
  to what is beside the intention, since this is accidental as explained above
  (43, 3; I-II, 12, 1). Accordingly the act of self-defense may have two effects,
  one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor.
  Therefore this act, since one's intention is to save one's own life, is
  not unlawful, seeing that it is natural to everything to keep itself in
  &quot;being,&quot; as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a
  good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion
  to the end. Wherefore if a man, in self-defense, uses more than necessary
  violence, it will be unlawful: whereas if he repel force with moderation
  his defense will be lawful, because according to the jurists [Cap. Significasti,
  De Homicid. volunt. vel casual.], &quot;it is lawful to repel force by force,
  provided one does not exceed the limits of a blameless defense.&quot; Nor
  is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of moderate self-defense
  in order to avoid killing the other man, since one is bound to take more
  care of one's own life than of another's. But as it is unlawful to take
  a man's life, except for the public authority acting for the common good,
  as stated above (3), it is not lawful for a man to intend killing a man
  in self-defense, except for such as have public authority, who while intending
  to kill a man in self-defense, refer this to the public good, as in the
  case of a soldier fighting against the foe, and in the minister of the judge
  struggling with robbers, although even these sin if they be moved by private
animosity. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 1. The words quoted from Augustine refer to the case
  when one man intends to kill another to save himself from death. The passage
  quoted in the Second Objection is to be understood in the same sense. Hence
  he says pointedly, &quot;for the sake of these things,&quot; whereby he
  indicates the intention. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 3. Irregularity results from the act though sinless
  of taking a man's life, as appears in the case of a judge who justly condemns
  a man to death. For this reason a cleric, though he kill a man in self-defense,
  is irregular, albeit he intends not to kill him, but to defend himself.</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 4. The act of fornication or adultery is not necessarily
  directed to the preservation of one's own life, as is the act whence sometimes
results the taking of a man's life. </h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Reply to Objection 5. The defense forbidden in this passage is that
  which comes from revengeful spite. Hence a gloss says: &quot;Not defending
yourselves--that is, not striking your enemy back.&quot; </h1>
