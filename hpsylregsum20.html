<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>As an introduction to philosophy, the course will focus on the fundamental
conceptions of the nature of the human person in ancient, medieval, modern,
and contemporary philosophy. It will also include the development of basic
logical and critical thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background
for future reflections on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject
matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting
the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to
the nature of the human person. It is expected by the end of the semester
that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and
be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of
the human person.</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>
<h3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions. Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be 12 weekly quizzes on pre-assigned readings, class lectures, and other extra credit opportunities (worth the equivalent of one quiz). Your 10 best grades in this category will be 20% of your grade. NOTE: There are NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES. There will be 3 TESTS (20 % each) throughout the summer session. There will also be 9 on-line book quizzes and two writing assignments (Thought Experiments--TE's) required of each student--and late assignments will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late. Your best TE, plus your nine on-line book quizzes will constitute the remaining 20% of your final grade. Finally, for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.</h3>
