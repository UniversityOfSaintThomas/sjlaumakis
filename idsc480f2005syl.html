<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>The notion of consciousness--our awareness of the internal and external
world--has always been a topic of intense interest to philosophers and scientists,
both Eastern and Western. The Western approach has tended to rely on the
scientific method, using empirical investigations and objective inquiry
to specify the nature of consciousness. A recent approach to understanding
the nature of consciousness and thought (which has emerged and gained prominence
over the past 50 years) is termed <I>cognitive science</I>. Cognitive science
represents an interdisciplinary attempt to understand the nature of thinking,
and is rooted primarily in the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology,
neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and anthropology. Perhaps
the most lively interaction among these disciplines lies at the crossroads
of the first three--philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology (more specifically,
cognitive psychology). In fact, much current work in cognitive science is
focused on trying to respond to basic philosophical questions about psychological
processes (e.g., What is the nature of consciousness?) with the tools of
brain science (e.g., brain imaging techniques such as PETscanning).</H3>

<H3>Eastern approaches (Buddhism, in particular) are also devoted to investigating
and understanding consciousness. However, their focus is on the analysis
of subjective experience through meditative practice, and the cultivation
of mindfulness-being awake and fully aware. Buddhists are especially concerned
with the practical and moral consequences of this meditative practice. This
subjective and contemplative approach to analyzing consciousness can be
seen in Western approaches in the form of analytic introspection (a popular
tool for analyzing consciousness early in the development of psychology),
but was largely abandoned as unscientific. Recently, however, the phenomenological
aspects of cognition and consciousness have made a comeback, and there has
been an important meeting of Eastern and Western minds with regard to the
analysis of consciousness. Both traditions are investigating the benefits
of meditation for psychological and physical well being, as well as what
the meditative state tells us about the nature of consciousness and thought.
(e.g., Houshmand, Livingston, &amp; Wallace, 1999). Most recently (in September
of 2003), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sponsored a conference
entitled <I>Investigating the Mind: Exchanges between Buddhism and the biobehavioral
brain sciences on how the mind works</I>, which featured a dialog between
leading proponents of the Buddhist and cognitive scientific views of mind.</H3>

<H3>This seminar will explore attempts by psychologists and Buddhists to
understand consciousness. The course will be organized topically, focusing
on both Western philosophical and psychological accounts of consciousness
and Buddhist theory and practice. The views to be considered include: recent
work by cognitive psychologists, cognitive scientists, and the teachings
of the Buddha as they have been interpreted by his Theravada, Mahayana,
and Tibetan followers. Readings will include primary and secondary sources
from each discipline. Students will be evaluated based on general class
discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations
and discussion leading.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:</H3>

<H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts. The first part
will be concerned with outlining the basic problem of consciousness. The
second part will be concerned with traditional Buddhist accounts of the
mind and consciousness. The third part will focus on a comparative analysis
of the perspectives considered in the seminar.</H3>

<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate
in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction
paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and
to student presentations based on the readings.</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin
with a lecture format (four weeks) as we present an overview of cognitive
science, consciousness and Buddhism. It will then proceed in seminar style
with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible
for three areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3)
Discussion Leading.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and/or optional Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for
the seminar.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assigned
readings. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on
the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a &quot;+/0/-&quot; scale. &quot;-&quot;
is missing or deficient (D-F). &quot;0&quot; is an adequate summary with
little or no analysis (B-C). &quot;+&quot; is a thoughtful, critical analysis
(A).</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2 students (by
WEEK #3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #3), and leading class discussion during
the week you present the issues involved in your topic.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3>
