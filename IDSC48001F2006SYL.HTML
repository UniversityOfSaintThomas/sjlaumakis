The seminar will be organized topically and geographically, focusing   on both Western and non-Western accounts of the goals and paths to &#8220;wisdom.&#8221;   Topics to be considered include: the nature of wisdom, the means of pursuing   and acquiring it, the subjective and environmental conditions necessary for   its pursuit and acquisition, and the costs and benefits of this for the individual,   his or her community, and the world.<br>  In order to focus the subject matter of the seminar we will pay particular attention   to two topics: the ethical and epistemic dimensions of wisdom. With respect   to the former, we will pay particular attention to the practical consequences   or actions that are thought to be required for and follow from the pursuit of   &#8220;wisdom.&#8221; With respect to the latter, attention will be paid to   a broad spectrum of cognitive categories ranging from sense data to knowledge   to understanding to enlightenment and ultimately to wisdom. The views to be   considered include: Greek, Roman, Chinese, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Indian,   African, Native American, Western Scientific, and even the American &#8220;intelligence   community.&#8221;</H2><H2 ALIGN=left>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an   on-line discussion of the readings as well as to prepare a 1-2 page reaction   paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student   presentations based on the readings. Students will be evaluated based on general   class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations   and discussion leading.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left>TEXTS:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Readings are selected for each class, partly by the professors and partly by   students assigned to each of 8 class sessions. Student discussion leaders will   meet with the instructors (at least two weeks prior to their discussion leading)   to discuss the readings they will be using and the topics/themes they will be   addressing. Discussion leaders will then formulate and post (at the seminar   Blackboard site) specific questions about the readings that will serve as the   basis of class discussion.<br></H2><H2 ALIGN=left>ASSIGNMENTS:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject   matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions,   and just plain make you think. Students will be responsible for three areas   of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and Web   postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.<br></H2><H2 ALIGN=left>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based   on pre-assigned readings. These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection   on the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a &#8220;+/0/-&#8220; scale. &#8220;-&#8220;   is missing or deficient (D-F). &#8220;0&#8221; is an adequate summary with little   or no analysis (B-C). &#8220;+&#8221; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).<br></H2><H2 ALIGN=left>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2 students   (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during   the week you present the issues involved in your topic. Discussion leaders are   evaluated on four dimensions: a) the quality of readings they select, b) the   quality of questions they create to stimulate learning among other students,   c) the quality of a short presentation each will make to start off their sessions,   and d) the skill by which they moderate discussion during their session.</H2><H2 ALIGN=left>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H2><H2 ALIGN=left><br>  Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.
