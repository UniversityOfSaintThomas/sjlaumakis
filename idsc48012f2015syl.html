<h4><strong><u>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>Sports seem to occupy a special place in American Culture. Major sporting events are regularly the highest rated television programs and tickets for those events routinely sell out. Why are sports such a huge part of our culture?</h4>
<h4>This seminar will examine the philosophy of sports, why we play sports and games, what meaning we derive from them and what role they do and should play in a well-ordered society.Â  It will also examine the positive and negative educational, social, psychological, physical, and financial effects of athletic participation for both the athlete and society in general.</h4>
<h4>Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, reaction papers, and in-class discussion leading. </h4>
<h4><strong><u>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>1. Gaining factual knowledge and fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories.</h4>
<h4>-This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation and discussion leading.</h4>
<h4>2. To acquire skills in working with others as a member of a team.</h4>
<h4>-This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.</h4>
<h4>3. Developing skill in expressing oneself orally and in writing.</h4>
<h4>-This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h4>
<h4>4. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.</h4>
<h4>-This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h4>
<h4><strong><u>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts.</h4>
<h4>The first part will focus on the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of the philosophy of sport, and the role of sport in contemporary society. The Second part will focus more narrowly on issues in the philosophy of sport. The third part will focus on specific issues related to sports in society.</h4>
<h4>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in on-line discussions of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings. Students are expected to devote about 3-4 hours of study each week to this seminar.</h4>
<h4><strong>NB</strong>: We realize that we live in the age of social media and constant connectivity. A seminar style, however, relies on effective communication skills from all involved. That means not only effectively presenting your ideas, but also listening attentively to others. To listen effectively you need to disconnect from e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, web surfing and other digital distractions during class time. If you bring a laptop or tablet to class it should be used only for class-related activities.</h4>
<h4><strong><u>TEXTS</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>Eitzen, Stanley D. ed. (2011) <u>Sport in Contemporary Society</u><br>
  Reid, Heather L. (2012),&nbsp;<u>Introduction to the Philosophy of Sport</u></h4>
<h4><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks, at most) as we present an overview of the philosophy of sport and the social issues related to sports in society. It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h4>
<h4>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Leading Discussion.</h4>
<h4>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.&nbsp; Students should be prepared for cold-calling during any class!</h4>
<h4>2) <strong>REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.&nbsp; These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.&nbsp; The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale.&nbsp; &ldquo;1&ldquo; is missing or deficient (D-F). &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).&nbsp;A grade of &quot;5&quot; is reserved for good analysis and is NOT easily attained!</h4>
<h4>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 3 students (by WEEK #2-3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2-3) in both the theoretical and practical realms of sports and society, and then leading class discussion during the weeks you present the issues involved in your topics.&nbsp; Students will be responsible for leading discussion two times.&nbsp; </h4>
<h4><strong><u>ATTENDANCE POLICY</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones! </h4>
<h4><strong><u>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</u></strong>:</h4>
<h4>Participation/Web = 40%<br>
  Reaction Papers = 30%<br>
  Discussion Leading = 20%<br>
  Additional 10% (Add in where you want!)</h4>
<h4><br>
  <strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This is an Honors Seminar--Students will be graded accordingly! </h4>
