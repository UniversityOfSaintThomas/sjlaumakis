It will also include the development of basic logical and critical   thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background for future reflections   on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</H3><H3><br>  The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting the questions   and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the nature of the   human person. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know something   of the thought of several major philosophers and be able to articulate coherently   your own understanding of the nature of the human person.</H3><H3><br>  REQUIRED TEXTS:</H3><H3><br>  BERKELEY, A TREATISE CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE<br>  BIFFLE, A GUIDED TOUR OF RENE DESCARTES' MEDITATIONS<br>  CAHILL, SAILING THE WINE-DARK SEA&#8212;WHY THE GREEKS MATTER<br>  LUCRETIUS, ON THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE<br>  PLATO, FIVE DIALOGUES<br>  SEARLE, MINDS, BRAINS, AND SCIENCE<br>  WESTON, A RULEBOOK FOR ARGUMENTS<br>  DIVERSITY READINGS&#8212;ONLINE &amp; OTHER SELECTED HANDOUTS</H3><H3><br>  ASSIGNMENTS:</H3><H3><br>  Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of   elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental   philosophical notions. Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce   you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose   distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be 2 SHORT   PAPERS (3-4 typed pages in length and NOT MORE THAN 5 TYPED PAGES) on pre-assigned   readings and topics. There will also be 2 EXAMS--a Mid-Term Exam and a Final   Exam at the end of the semester.</H3><H3><br>  ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3><H3><br>  Attendance is expected.
