Morespecifically, the course will help students develop the philosophical abilityto reflect on both practical and theoretical issues involving the natureand place of technology and its impact on the lives of human beings.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>REQUIRED TEXTS:</P><P>FERRE, PHILOSOPHY OF TECHNOLOGY</P><P>MITCHAM &amp; MACKEY, PHILOSOPHY AND TECHNOLOGY</P><P>MOKYR, THE LEVER OF RICHES</P><P>SELECTED HANDOUTS</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>ASSIGNMENTS:</P><P>Since this is a course relying upon concepts and models stemming fromboth theoretical and practical sources in an attempt to integrate aspectsof these diverse branches of higher learning, you are asked to concentrateon learning these distinct but related notions.  Reading of assigned textsis a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate classdiscussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plainmake you THINK.  There will be 3 SHORT PAPERS (2-3 typed pages in lengthand NOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES) on pre-assigned topics and readings.  Onepaper will be presented in class (with a one-page outline for each memberof the class).  There will also be at least 2 EXAMS/TESTS.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</P><P>Attendance is expected.
