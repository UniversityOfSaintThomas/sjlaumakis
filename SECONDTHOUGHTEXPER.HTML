Bodily Torture<br>  Suppose someone tells you that the person in your body is going to be tortured   tomorrow. This person, however, will have none of your memories and you will   have no memory of being tortured. Should you fear being tortured? Why or why   not?</h3><h3 ALIGN=left><br>  2. Parfit&#8217;s Reformed Nobelist<br>  Suppose that a man aged ninety, one of the few rightful holders of the Nobel   Peace Prize, confesses that it was he who, at the age of twenty, injured a policeman   in a drunken brawl. Though this was a serious crime, does he deserve to be punished   for it now? Why or why not?<br></h3><h3 ALIGN=left>3. Peter &amp; Paul<br>  Suppose that Peter, a right-wing extremist who believes that the government   has no right to tax the rich to give to the poor, blows up an IRS office and   injures many people. To escape capture, he sets up residence in a small community   and changes his name to Paul. After working in the local soup kitchen for a   number of years, he joins the fire department, saves many lives, and becomes   very active in community service projects. He also joins a local church and   teaches Sunday school regularly. One night, while studying the Bible, he has   a religious experience and becomes a born-again Christian. As a result, he decides   to devote his life to helping the needy. Paul now finds it impossible to identify   with the thoughts, feelings, and desires that motivated Peter. Peter&#8217;s   beliefs, attitudes, and values seem totally alien to Paul. Although Paul can   vaguely remember the bombing, he knows that he would never do such a thing.   Given what you know about personal identity, do you believe that Paul should   be punished for what Peter did? Why or why not?</h3><h3></h3><div align="left"></div></BODY></HTML>
