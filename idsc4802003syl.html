<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>What is the meaning of life? Is there life after death? What effect
will my choices and actions here and now have on my future existence? Can
and will I be saved? How will that happen? Questions like these have been
considered by philosophers and theologians throughout history. How exactly
do they arrive at their answers? What kinds of methods and evidence do they
use to investigate, support and explain their answers? What do the most
influential accounts look like?</H3>

<H3>This seminar will examine four of the most influential answers to the
preceding questions by exploring the teachings of the Socrates, Buddha,
Confucius, and Jesus. It will also consider how Eastern and Western views
of salvation are distinct and related. As a result, this seminar is designed
to provide a structured opportunity for philosophical and theological reflection
on four of the most influential accounts of the meaning and purpose of life
and what happens afterward. It will help students develop: 1. a vocabulary
of terms and concepts for considering &quot;salvation&quot; questions, 2.
a framework for critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of four
of the most influential answers to these questions, and 3. a personal understanding
of the effects of these views on both individual human actions and society.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>COURSE STRUCTURE:</H3>

<H3>The seminar will be divided into four parts. We will begin by considering
various philosophical and theological notions of &quot;the meaning and purpose
of life&quot; and &quot;salvation.&quot; The first part will then be concerned
with the life, beliefs, and arguments of Socrates. The second part will
be concerned with the teachings of the Buddha and Buddhist conceptions of
&quot;nirvana.&quot; The third part will focus on Confucius and other Chinese
conceptions of the goal of life. The fourth part will be concerned with
the teachings of Jesus.</H3>

<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate
in an on-line discussion of the readings. Class time will be devoted to
discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.</H3>

<H3>A final paper will be required of each student. A topic will be selected
early in the class and students will accumulate material from each section
of the course to incorporate in their final paper.</H3>

<H3>1. Conze, Buddhist Scriptures</H3>

<H3>2. Confucius, Analects</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The course will begin
with a lecture format (roughly 2 weeks) as we present an overview of the
lives and thought of Socrates, Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus. It will then
proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.
Students will be responsible for four areas of activity: 1) Class Participation,
2) Web Participation, 3) Discussion Leading, and 4) a Final Paper.</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and Web postings at the Blackboard Threaded Discussion Area arranged for
the seminar. Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each
week.</H3>

<H3>2) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of choosing a date and selected reading
and meeting with Dr. Landry &amp; Dr. Laumakis to discuss the readings (at
least one week before your topic is to be discussed), posting questions
and comments for discussion on the Web prior to your discussion, and leading
class discussion.</H3>

<H3>3) THE FINAL PAPER consists of an extended (10? page) discussion and
evaluation of some topic or theme treated in the seminar. Late papers will
be penalized one full grade for each day they are late.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3>

<H3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>GRADE DISTRIBUTION:</H3>

<H3>Participation in Class = 20% Participation on the Web = 20%</H3>
