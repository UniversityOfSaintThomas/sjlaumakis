<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>As an introduction to philosophy, the course will focus on the fundamental
conceptions of the nature of the human person in ancient, medieval, modern,
and contemporary philosophy. It will also include the development of basic
logical and critical thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background
for future reflections on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject
matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting
the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to
the nature of the human person. It is expected by the end of the semester
that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and
be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of
the human person.</H3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>ASSIGNMENTS:</h3>
<h3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions. &nbsp; Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. &nbsp; There will be 11 "weekly" quizzes on pre-assigned readings and class lectures, 3 Thoought Experiements (TE's), and other extra credit opportunities (worth the equivalent of one quiz). There are <strong>NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES</strong>.  There will also be 4 TESTS throughout the semester. &nbsp; Make-up TESTS are possible <strong>ONLY UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES </strong> (i.e., your near-death or other kinds of serious illness that would involve a note from your doctor, a family or parenting-related emergency, or a UST-sponsored event--early purchase of an airline ticket does not count as such an excuse!). &nbsp; If you need to schedule a make-up you should see me <strong>ASAP </strong> to see if your situation meets the conditions under which a make-up may be taken. Make-up TESTS are completely different from regular tests and typically all-essay.  There will also be at least two writing assignments required of each student--and late assignments will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late. The Food TE and your other best TE, plus your remaining eight best grades from the quizzes and extra credit will constitute 20% of your final grade. Finally, for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.</h3>
