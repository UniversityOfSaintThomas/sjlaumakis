<h3><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u>:</h3>
<h3>As an introduction to philosophy, this course (1) enquires into the foundations of ethics, by (2) considering how our conception of the human person affects our understanding of the good human life. It also (3) considers the question of the rationality of belief in God and the difference (if any) God&rsquo;s existence makes to our understanding of the person and the good. In addressing each of these topics, the course (4) develops and applies basic logical and critical thinking skills, introduced as an essential part of philosophical method. </h3>
<h3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the nature of the human person, ethics, and the existence of God--using philosophical methodology, and with substantial attention to Catholic intellectual tradition. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of the human person and the good human life.</h3>

<h3><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u>:<u></u></h3>
<h3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions. Reading of assigned texts is a <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be 2 SHORT PAPERS (2-3 typed pages in length and <strong><u>NOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES</u></strong>) on pre-assigned readings. One paper will be presented to the class along with a 1-page summary/outline for the other members of the class. There will also be 2 EXAMS--a Mid-Term Exam and a Final Exam at the end of the semester. There will be 11 &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; quizzes on pre-assigned readings and class lectures, 3 Thought Experiments (TE&rsquo;s), and other extra credit opportunities. There are <strong><u>NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES</u></strong>. There will also be on-line book quizzes worth at least 10% of your grade. Make-up EXAMS are possible <strong><u>ONLY UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES</u></strong> (i.e., your near-death or other kinds of serious illness that would involve a note from your doctor, a family or parenting-related emergency, or a UST-sponsored event--early purchase of an airline ticket for  Spring Break or  Easter does not count as such an excuse!). If you need to schedule a make-up you should see me <strong><u>ASAP</u></strong> to see if your situation meets the conditions under which a make-up may be taken. Make-up EXAMS are completely different from regular exams and typically all-essay. Late assignments will be penalized a full grade for each day they are late. Finally, for every hour of class time, students are expected to devote 2-3 hours of study to this course, including homework reading, review, and written assignments.</h3>

Given the uncertainties surrounding the virus and its potential impact on our class, please familiarize yourself with the SPECIAL GUIDELINES DUE TO COVID-19 FOR COURSE ATTENDANCE. </h3>
