These thinkers include:  Pierre Rousselot, Joseph Marechal, JacquesMaritain, Etienne Gilson, Karl Rahner, and Bernard Lonergan.</H3><H3>The aim of the course is to study both the intellectual influence andhistorical development of the thought of Thomas Aquinas in his philosophicaland theological successors.  The versions of Thomism to be studied include: Aristotelian Thomism, Existential Thomism, Historical Thomism, PlatonicThomism, Transcendental Thomism, and Analytical Thomism.  It is expectedby the end of the semester that you both know something of the thought ofthe major Thomistic philosophers and theologians of the 20th century andbe able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the evolutionand development of 20th century Thomism.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>REQUIRED TEXTS:</H3><H3>HUDSON &amp; MORAN (EDS), THE FUTURE OF THOMISM</H3><H3>KNASAS (ED), THOMISTIC PAPERS VI</H3><H3>POPE LEO XIII, ON THE RESTORATION OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY--AETERNI PATRIS</H3><H3>McCOOL, THE NEO-THOMISTS</H3><H3>McCOOL, FROM UNITY TO PLURALISM: THE INTERNAL EVOLUTION OF THOMISM</H3><H3>SELECTED HANDOUTS</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3><H3>Since this is an upper level course emphasizing the understanding andintegration of complex and interrelated ideas, you are asked to concentrateon assimilating these philosophical concepts and notions.  Reading of assignedtexts is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitateclass discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and justplain make you think.  The course will begin with a lecture format (roughly4 weeks) as we review the philosophy and theology of Thomas Aquinas as wellas the history of philosophy in the Modern and Contemporary periods.  Itwill then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on studentparticipation.  There will be 2 PAPERS (One 2-3 typed pages in length andNOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES and One longer paper) on pre-assigned readings. The first or shorter paper will be presented to the class along with aone page outline.  The longer paper will focus on the specific ideas ofone of the 20th century Thomists.  Late papers will be penalized one fullgrade for each day they are late.  There will also be 2 EXAMS--a Mid-TermExam and a Final Exam at the end of the semester.</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>Attendance is expected.
