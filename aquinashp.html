We shall treat first of the natureof the human person, and secondly of his origin. Now the theologian considersthe nature of the person in relation to the soul; but not in relation tothe body, except in so far as the body has relation to the soul. Hence thefirst Object of our consideration will be the soul. And since Dionysius(Ang. Hier. xi) says that three things are to be found in spiritual substances-essence,power, and operation-we shall treat first of what belongs to the essenceof the soul; secondly, of what belongs to its power; thirdly, of what belongsto its operation.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Concerning the first, two points have to be considered;the first is the nature of the soul considered in itself; the second isthe union of the soul with the body. Under the first head there are sevenpoints of inquiry:</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(1) Whether the soul is a body?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(2) Whether the human soul is a subsistence?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(3) Whether the souls of brute animals are subsistent?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(4) Whether the soul is the person, or is the person composedof soul and body?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(5) Whether the soul is composed of matter and form?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(6) Whether the soul is incorruptible?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(7) Whether the soul is of the same species as an angel?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER><HR>Article 1: Whether the soul is a body?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the soul is a body:</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For the soul is the moving principle of the body. Nordoes it move unless moved. First, because seemingly nothing can move unlessit is itself moved, since nothing gives what it has not; for instance, whatis not hot does not give heat. Secondly, because if there be anything thatmoves and is not moved, it must be the cause of eternal, unchanging movement,as we find proved Phys. viii, 6; and this does not appear to be the casein the movement of an animal, which is caused by the soul. Therefore thesoul is a mover moved. But every mover moved is a body. Therefore the soulis a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, all knowledge is caused by means of a likeness.But there can be no likeness of a body to an incorporeal thing. If, therefore,the soul were not a body, it could not have knowledge of corporeal things.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, between the mover and the moved there mustbe contact. But contact is only between bodies. Since, therefore, the soulmoves the body, it seems that the soul must be a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 6) thatthe soul &quot;is simple in comparison with the body, inasmuch as it doesnot occupy space by its bulk.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: To seek the nature of the soul, we must premisethat the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those thingswhich live: for we call living things &quot;animate,&quot; [i.e. havinga soul], and those things which have no life, &quot;inanimate.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Now life is shown principally by two actions, knowledgeand movement. The philosophers of old, not being able to rise above theirimagination, supposed that the principle of these actions was somethingcorporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were real things; and thatwhat is not corporeal is nothing: hence they maintained that the soul issomething corporeal. This opinion can be proved to be false in many ways;but we shall make use of only one proof, based on universal and certainprinciples, which shows clearly that the soul is not a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It is manifest that not every principle of vital actionis a soul, for then the eye would be a soul, as it is a principle of vision;and the same might be applied to the other instruments of the soul: butit is the &quot;first&quot; principle of life, which we call the soul. Now,though a body may be a principle of life, as the heart is a principle oflife in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle of life.For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be a living thing,does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were the case, every bodywould be a living thing, or a principle of life. Therefore a body is competentto be a living thing or even a principle of life, as &quot;such&quot; abody. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to some principle whichis called its act. Therefore the soul, which is the first principle of life,is not a body, but the act of a body; thus heat, which is the principleof calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: As everything which is in motionmust be moved by something else, a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely,we must allow that not every mover is moved. For, since to be moved is topass from potentiality to actuality, the mover gives what it has to thething moved, inasmuch as it causes it to be in act. But, as is shown inPhys. viii, 6, there is a mover which is altogether immovable, and not movedeither essentially, or accidentally; and such a mover can cause an invariablemovement. There is, however, another kind of mover, which, though not movedessentially, is moved accidentally; and for this reason it does not causean invariable movement; such a mover, is the soul. There is, again, anothermover, which is moved essentially-namely, the body. And because the philosophersof old believed that nothing existed but bodies, they maintained that everymover is moved; and that the soul is moved directly, and is a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: The likeness of a thing known isnot of necessity actually in the nature of the knower; but given a thingwhich knows potentially, and afterwards knows actually, the likeness ofthe thing known must be in the nature of the knower, not actually, but onlypotentially; thus color is not actually in the pupil of the eye, but onlypotentially. Hence it is necessary, not that the likeness of corporeal thingsshould be actually in the nature of the soul, but that there be a potentialityin the soul for such a likeness. But the ancient philosophers omitted todistinguish between actuality and potentiality; and so they held that thesoul mu st be a body in order to have knowledge of a body; and that it mustbe composed of the principles of which all bodies are formed in order toknow all bodies.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: There are two kinds of contact; of&quot;quantity,&quot; and of &quot;power.&quot; By the former a body canbe touched only by a body; by the latter a body can be touched by an incorporealthing, which moves that body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER><HR>Article 2: Whether the human soul is something subsistent?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the human soul is not something subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For that which subsists is said to be &quot;this particularthing.&quot; Now &quot;this particular thing&quot; is said not of the soul,but of that which is composed of soul and body. Therefore the soul is notsomething subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, everything subsistent operates. But the souldoes not operate; for, as the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 4), &quot;tosay that the soul feels or understands is like saying that the soul weavesor builds.&quot; Therefore the soul is not subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would havesome operation apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from thebody, not even that of understanding: for the act of understanding doesnot take place without a phantasm, which cannot exist apart from the body.Therefore the human soul is not something subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, Augustine says (De Trin. x, 7): &quot;Whounderstands that the nature of the soul is that of a substance and not thatof a body, will see that those who maintain the corporeal nature of thesoul, are led astray through associating with the soul those things withoutwhich they are unable to think of any nature-i.e. imaginary pictures ofcorporeal things.&quot; Therefore the nature of the human intellect is notonly incorporeal, but it is also a substance, that is, something subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: It must necessarily be allowed that the principleof intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporealand subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can haveknowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things cannothave any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it naturallywould impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe that a sickman's tongue being vitiated by a feverish and bitter humor, is insensibleto anything sweet, and everything seems bitter to it. Therefore, if theintellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would be unableto know all bodies. Now every body has its own determinate nature. Thereforeit is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a body. It is likewiseimpossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ; since the determinatenature of that organ would impede knowledge of all bodies; as when a certaindeterminate color is not only in the pupil of the eye, but also in a glassvase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same color.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Therefore the intellectual principle which we call themind or the intellect has an operation per se apart from the body. Now onlythat which subsists can have an operation per se. For nothing can operatebut what is actual: for which reason we do not say that heat imparts heat,but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude, therefore, that the humansoul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is something incorporealand subsistent.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: &quot;This particular thing&quot;can be taken in two senses. Firstly, for anything subsistent; secondly,for that which subsists, and is complete in a specific nature. The formersense excludes the inherence of an accident or of a material form; the latterexcludes also the imperfection of the part, so that a hand can be called&quot;this particular thing&quot; in the first sense, but not in the second.Therefore, as the human soul is a part of human nature, it can indeed becalled &quot;this particular thing,&quot; in the first sense, as being somethingsubsistent; but not in the second, for in this sense, what is composed ofbody and soul is said to be &quot;this particular thing.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: Aristotle wrote those words as expressingnot his own opinion, but the opinion of those who said that to understandis to be moved, as is clear from the context. Or we may reply that to operateper se belongs to what exists per se. But for a thing to exist per se, itsuffices sometimes that it be not inherent, as an accident or a materialform; even though it be part of something. Nevertheless, that is rightlysaid to subsist per se, which is neither inherent in the above sense, norpart of anything else. In this sense, the eye or the hand cannot be saidto subsist per se; nor can it for that reason be said to operate per se.Hence the operation of the parts is through each part attributed to thewhole. For we say that man sees with the eye, and feels with the hand, andnot in the same sense as when we say that what is hot gives heat by itsheat; for heat, strictly speaking, does not give heat. We may thereforesay that the soul understands, as the eye sees; but it is more correct tosay that man understands through the soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: The body is necessary for the actionof the intellect, not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object;for the phantasm is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neitherdoes such a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent;otherwise it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requiresexternal objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER><HR>Article 4: Whether the soul is the person?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the soul is the person.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For it is written (2 Cor. 4:16): &quot;Though our outwardperson is corrupted, yet the in ward person is renewed day by day.&quot;But that which is within the person is the soul. Therefore the soul is theinward person.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, the human soul is a substance. But it is nota universal substance. Therefore it is a particular substance. Thereforeit is a &quot;hypostasis&quot; or a person; and it can only be a human person.Therefore the soul is the person; for a human person is a person.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commendsVarro as holding &quot;that the person is not a mere soul, nor a mere body;but both soul and body.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: The assertion &quot;the soul is a person,&quot;can be taken in two senses. First, that the person is a soul; though thisparticular person, Socrates, for instance, is not a soul, but composed ofsoul and body. I say this, forasmuch as some held that the form alone belongsto the species; while matter is part of the individual, and not the species.This cannot be true; for to the nature of the species belongs what the definitionsignifies; and in natural things the definition does not signify the formonly, but the form and the matter. Hence in natural things the matter ispart of the species; not, indeed, signate matter, which is the principleof individuality; but the common matter. For as it belongs to the notionof this particular person to be composed of this soul, of this flesh, andof these bones; so it belongs to the notion of person to be composed ofsoul, flesh, and bones; for whatever belongs in common to the substanceof all the individuals contained under a given species, must belong to thesubstance of the species. It may also be understood in this sense, thatthis soul is this person; and this could be held if it were supposed thatthe operation of the sensitive soul were proper to it, apart from the body;because in that case all the operations which are attributed to the personwould belong to the soul only; and whatever performs the operations properto a thing, is that thing; wherefore that which performs the operationsof a person is a person. But it has been shown above (A3) that sensationis not the operation of the soul only. Since, then, sensation is an operationof man, but not proper to him, it is clear that man is not a soul only,but something composed of soul and body. Plato, through supposing that sensationwas proper to the soul, could maintain the person to be a soul making useof the body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: According to the Philosopher (Ethic.ix, 8), a thing seems to be chiefly what is principle in it; thus what thegovernor of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimeswhat is principle in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the intellectualpart which, in accordance with truth, is called the &quot;inward&quot; man;and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinionof those whose observation does not go beyond the senses. And this is calledthe &quot;outward&quot; man.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: Not every particular substance isa hypostasis or a person, but that which has the complete nature of itsspecies. Hence a hand, or a foot, is not called a hypostasis, or a person;nor, likewise, is the soul alone so called, since it is a part of the humanspecies.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER><HR></h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Article 5: Whether the soul is composed of matter and form?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Objection 1. It would seem that the soul is composed ofmatter and form. For potentiality is opposed to actuality. Now, whatsoeverthings are in actuality participate of the First Act, which is God; by participationof Whom, all things are good, are beings, and are living things, as is clearfrom the teaching of Dionysius (Div. Nom. v). Therefore whatsoever thingsare in potentiality participate of the first potentiality. But the firstpotentiality is primary matter. Therefore, since the human soul is, aftera manner, in potentiality; which appears from the fact that sometimes aman is potentially understanding; it seems that the human soul must participateof primary matter, as part of itself. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Objection 2. Further, wherever the properties of matterare found, there matter is. But the properties of matter are found in thesoul--namely, to be a subject, and to be changed, for it is a subject toscience, and virtue; and it changes from ignorance to knowledge and fromvice to virtue. Therefore matter is in the soul. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Objection 3. Further, things which have no matter, haveno cause of their existence, as the Philosopher says Metaph. viii (Did.vii, 6). But the soul has a cause of its existence, since it is createdby God. Therefore the soul has matter. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Objection 4. Further, what has no matter, and is a formonly, is a pure act, and is infinite. But this belongs to God alone. Thereforethe soul has matter. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the contrary, Augustine (Gen. ad lit. vii, 7,8,9) provesthat the soul was made neither of corporeal matter, nor of spiritual matter.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>I answer that, The soul has no matter. We may considerthis question in two ways. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>First, from the notion of a soul in general; for it belongsto the notion of a soul to be the form of a body. Now, either it is a formby virtue of itself, in its entirety, or by virtue of some part of itself.If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it is impossible that any partof it should be matter, if by matter we understand something purely potential:for a form, as such, is an act; and that which is purely potentiality cannotbe part of an act, since potentiality is repugnant to actuality as beingopposite thereto. If, however, it be a form by virtue of a part of itself,then we call that part the soul: and that matter, which it actualizes first,we call the &quot;primary animate.&quot; </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Secondly, we may proceed from the specific notion of thehuman soul inasmuch as it is intellectual. For it is clear that whateveris received into something is received according to the condition of therecipient. Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower.But the intellectual soul knows a thing in its nature absolutely: for instance,it knows a stone absolutely as a stone; and therefore the form of a stoneabsolutely, as to its proper formal idea, is in the intellectual soul. Thereforethe intellectual soul itself is an absolute form, and not something composedof matter and form. For if the intellectual soul were composed of matterand form, the forms of things would be received into it as individuals,and so it would only know the individual: just as it happens with the sensitivepowers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since matter is the principleby which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore, that the intellectualsoul, and every intellectual substance which has knowledge of forms absolutely,is exempt from composition of matter and form. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Reply to Objection 1. The First Act is the universal principleof all acts; because It is infinite, virtually &quot;precontaining all things,&quot;as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v). Wherefore things participate of It notas a part of themselves, but by diffusion of Its processions. Now as potentialityis receptive of act, it must be proportionate to act. But the acts receivedwhich proceed from the First Infinite Act, and are participations thereof,are diverse, so that there cannot be one potentiality which receives allacts, as there is one act, from which all participated acts are derived;for then the receptive potentiality would equal the active potentialityof the First Act. Now the receptive potentiality in the intellectual soulis other than the receptive potentiality of first matter, as appears fromthe diversity of the things received by each. For primary matter receivesindividual forms; whereas the intelligence receives absolute forms. Hencethe existence of such a potentiality in the intellectual soul does not provethat the soul is composed of matter and form. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Reply to Objection 2. To be a subject and to be changedbelong to matter by reason of its being in potentiality. As, therefore,the potentiality of the intelligence is one thing and the potentiality ofprimary matter another, so in each is there a different reason of subjectionand change. For the intelligence is subject to knowledge, and is changedfrom ignorance to knowledge, by reason of its being in potentiality withregard to the intelligible species. </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Reply to Objection 3. The form causes matter to be, andso does the agent; wherefore the agent causes matter to be, so far as itactualizes it by transmuting it to the act of a form. A subsistent form,however, does not owe its existence to some formal principle, nor has ita cause transmuting it from potentiality to act. So after the words quotedabove, the Philosopher concludes, that in things composed of matter andform &quot;there is no other cause but that which moves from potentialityto act; while whatsoever things have no matter are simply beings at once.&quot;[The Leonine edition has, &quot;simpliciter sunt quod vere entia aliquid.&quot;The Parma edition of St. Thomas's Commentary on Aristotle has, &quot;statimper se unum quiddam est . . . et ens quiddam.&quot;] </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Reply to Objection 4. Everything participated is comparedto the participator as its act. But whatever created form be supposed tosubsist &quot;per se,&quot; must have existence by participation; for &quot;evenlife,&quot; or anything of that sort, &quot;is a participator of existence,&quot;as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v). Now participated existence is limited bythe capacity of the participator; so that God alone, Who is His own existence,is pure act and infinite. But in intellectual substances there is compositionof actuality and potentiality, not, indeed, of matter and form, but of formand participated existence. Wherefore some say that they are composed ofthat &quot;whereby they are&quot; and that &quot;which they are&quot;; forexistence itself is that by which a thing is. <BR><HR></h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Article 6: Whether the human soul is incorruptible? </h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the human soul is corruptible.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For those things that have a like beginning and processseemingly have a like end. But the beginning, by generation, of men is likethat of animals, for they are made from the earth. And the process of lifeis alike in both; because &quot;all things breathe alike, and man hath nothingmore than the beast,&quot; as it is written (Eccles. 3: 19). Therefore,as the same text concludes, &quot;the death of man and beast is one, andthe condition of both is equal.&quot; But the souls of brute animals arecorruptible. Therefore, also, the human soul is corruptible.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, whatever is out of nothing can return to nothingness;because the end should correspond to the beginning. But as it is written(Wis. 2:2), &quot;We are born of nothing&quot;; which is true, not onlyof the body, but also of the soul. Therefore, as is concluded in the samepassage, &quot;After this we shall be as if we had not been,&quot; evenas to our soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, nothing is without its own proper operation.But the operation proper to the soul, which is to understand through a phantasm,cannot be without the body. For the soul understands nothing without a phantasm;and there is no phantasm without the body as the Philosopher says (De Animai, 1). Therefore the soul cannot survive the dissolution of the body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that humansouls owe to Divine goodness that they are &quot;intellectual,&quot; andthat they have &quot;an incorruptible substantial life.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: We must assert that the intellectual principlewhich we call the human soul is incorruptible. For a thing may be corruptedin two ways-per se, and accidentally. Now it is impossible for any substanceto be generated or corrupted accidentally, that is, by the generation orcorruption of something else. For generation and corruption belong to athing, just as existence belongs to it, which is acquired by generationand lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has existence per se cannotbe generated or corrupted except per se; while things which do not subsist,such as accidents and material forms, acquire existence or lose it throughthe generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was shown above(aa. 2,3) that the souls of brutes are not self-subsistent, whereas thehuman soul is; so that the souls of brutes are corrupted, when their bodiesare corrupted; while the human soul could not be corrupted unless it werecorrupted per se. This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards the humansoul, but also as regards anything subsistent that is a form alone. Forit is clear that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparablefrom it; but existence belongs to a form, which is an act, by virtue ofitself. Wherefore matter acquires actual existence as it acquires the form;while it is corrupted so far as the form is separated from it. But it isimpossible for a form to be separated from itself; and therefore it is impossiblefor a subsistent form to cease to exist.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Granted even that the soul is composed of matter and form,as some pretend, we should nevertheless have to maintain that it is incorruptible.For corruption is found only where there is contrariety; since generationand corruption are from contraries and into contraries. Wherefore the heavenlybodies, since they have no matter subject to contrariety, are incorruptible.Now there can be no contrariety in the intellectual soul; for it receivesaccording to the manner of its existence, and those things which it receivesare without contrariety; for the notions even of contraries are not themselvescontrary, since contraries belong to the same knowledge. Therefore it isimpossible for the intellectual soul to be corruptible.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Moreover we may take a sign of this from the fact thateverything naturally aspires to existence after its own manner. Now, inthings that have knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge. The senses indeeddo not know existence, except under the conditions of &quot;here&quot; and&quot;now,&quot; whereas the intellect apprehends existence absolutely,and for all time; so that everything that has an intellect naturally desiresalways to exist. But a natural desire cannot be in vain. Therefore everyintellectual substance is incorruptible.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: Solomon reasons thus in the personof the foolish, as expressed in the words of Wisdom 2. Therefore the sayingthat man and animals have a like beginning in generation is true of thebody; for all animals alike are made of earth. But it is not true of thesoul. For the souls of brutes are produced by some power of the body; whereasthe human soul is produced by God. To signify this it is written as to otheranimals: &quot;Let the earth bring forth the living soul&quot; (Gn. 1:24):while of man it is written (Gn. 2:7) that &quot;He breathed into his facethe breath of life.&quot; And so in the last chapter of Ecclesiastes (12:7)it is concluded: &quot;(Before) the dust return into its earth from whenceit was; and the spirit return to God Who gave it.&quot; Again the processof life is alike as to the body, concerning which it is written (Eccles.3:19): &quot;All things breathe alike,&quot; and (Wis. 2:2), &quot;The breathin our nostrils is smoke.&quot; But the process is not alike of the soul;for man is intelligent, whereas animals are not. Hence it is false to say:&quot;Man has nothing more than beasts.&quot; Thus death comes to both alikeas to the body, by not as to the soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: As a thing can be created by reason,not of a passive potentiality, but only of the active potentiality of theCreator, Who can produce something out of nothing, so when we say that athing can be reduced to nothing, we do not imply in the creature a potentialityto non-existence, but in the Creator the power of ceasing to sustain existence.But a thing is said to be corruptible because there is in it a potentialityto non-existence.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: To understand through a phantasmis the proper operation of the soul by virtue of its union with the body.After separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding,similar to other substances separated from bodies, as will appear lateron (Q89, A1).</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER><HR>Question 76</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Of the Union of Body &amp; Soul(8 Articles)<HR></h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>We now consider the union of the soul with the body; andconcerning this there are eight points of inquiry:</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(1) Whether the intellectual principle is united to thebody as its form?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(2) Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied numericallyaccording to the number of bodies; or is there one intelligence for allpersons?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(3) Whether in the body the form of which is an intellectualprinciple, there is some other soul?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(4) Whether in the body there is any other substantialform?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(5) Of the qualities required in the body of which theintellectual principle is the form?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(6) Whether it be united to such a body by means of anotherbody?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(7) Whether by means of an accident?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>(8) Whether the soul is wholly in each part of the body?<HR></h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Article 1: Whether the intellectual principle is unitedto the body as its form?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the intellectual principle is not unitedto the body as its form:</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1: For the Philosopher says (De Anima ii i, 4) that theintellect is &quot;separate,&quot; and that it is not the act of any body.Therefore it is not united to the body as its form.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, every form is determined according to the natureof the matter of which it is the form; otherwise no proportion would berequired between matter and form. Therefore if the intellect were unitedto the body as its form, since every body has a determinate nature, it wouldfollow that the intellect has a determinate nature; and thus, it would notbe capable of knowing all things, as is clear from what has been said (Q75,A2); which is contrary to the nature of the intellect. Therefore the intellectis not united to the body as its form.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body,receives a form materially and individually; for what is received must bereceived according to the condition of the receiver. But the form of thething understood is not received into the intellect materially and individually,but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the intellect would notbe capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects, but onlyof individuals, like the senses. Therefore the intellect is not united tothe body as its form.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>4. Further, power and action have the same subject; forthe same subject is what can, and does, act. But the intellectual actionis not the action of a body, as appears from above (Q75, A2). Thereforeneither is the intellectual faculty a power of the body. But virtue or powercannot be more abstract or more simple than the essence from which the facultyor power is derived. Therefore neither is the substance of the intellectthe form of a body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>5. Further, whatever has per se existence is not unitedto the body as its form; because a form is that by which a thing exists:so that the very existence of a form does not belong to the form by itself.But the intellectual principle has per se existence and is subsistent, aswas said above (Q75, A2). Therefore it is not united to the body as itsform.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>6. Further, whatever exists in a thing by reason of itsnature exists in it always. But to be united to matter belongs to the formby reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an accidentalquality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form would not makea thing substantially one, but only accidentally one. Therefore a form cannotbe without its own proper matter. But the intellectual principle, sinceit is incorruptible, as was shown above (Q75, A6), remains separate fromthe body, after the dissolution of the body. Therefore the intellectualprinciple is not united to the body as its form.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, According to the Philosopher, Metaph.viii (Did. vii 2), difference is derived from the form. But the differencewhich constitutes man is &quot;rational,&quot; which is applied to man onaccount of his intellectual principle. Therefore the intellectual principleis the form of man.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: We must assert that the intellect which is theprinciple of intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For thatwhereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the actis to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healedis health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hencehealth is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The reasonis because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; wherefore a thingacts by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thingby which the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through variousoperations in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarilyperform each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the soul is theprimary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; andlikewise of our understanding. Therefore this principle by which we primarilyunderstand, whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul,is the form of the body. This is the demonstration used by Aristotle (DeAnima ii, 2).</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not theform of the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understandingis the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that itis himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone inthree ways, as is clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing issaid to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance, asa physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye; orthrough an accidental quality, as when we say that something that is whitebuilds, because it is accidental to the builder to be white. So when wesay that Socrates or Plato understands, it is clear that this is not attributedto him accidentally; since it is ascribed to him as man, which is predicatedof him essentially. We must therefore say either that Socrates understandsby virtue of his whole self, as Plato maintained, holding that man is anintellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part of Socrates. The firstcannot stand, as was shown above (Q75, A4), for this reason, that it isone and the same man who is conscious both that he understands, and thathe senses. But one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body mustbe some part of man. It follows therefore that the intellect by which Socratesunderstands is a part of Socrates, so that in some way it is united to thebody of Socrates.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Commentator held that this union is through the intelligiblespecies, as having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and in thephantasms which are in the corporeal organs. Thus through the intelligiblespecies the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particularman. But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, thatthe act of the intellect is the act of Socrates. This can be clearly seenfrom comparison with the sensitive faculty, from which Aristotle proceedsto consider things relating to the intellect. For the relation of phantasmsto the intellect is like the relation of colors to the sense of sight, ashe says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore, as the species of colors are in thesight, so are the species of phantasms in the possible intellect. Now itis clear that because the colors, the images of which are in the sight,are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: for wedo not say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen. Therefore, fromthe fact that the species of phantasms are in the possible intellect, itdoes not follow that Socrates, in whom are the phantasms, understands, butthat he or his phantasms are understood.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect isunited to the body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body formone thing so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole.This is, however, absurd for many reasons. First, because the intellectdoes not move the body except through the appetite, the movement of whichpresupposes the operation of the intellect. The reason therefore why Socratesunderstands is not because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise,he is moved by his intellect because he understands. Secondly, because sinceSocrates is an individual in a nature of one essence composed of matterand form, if the intellect be not the form, it follows that it must be outsidethe essence, and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as a motor tothe thing moved. Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, anddoes not pass into something else, as does the action of heating. Thereforethe action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reasonthat he is moved by his intellect. Thirdly, because the action of a motoris never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as theaction of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if understanding is attributedto Socrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is attributedto him as to an instrument. This is contrary to the teaching of the Philosopher,who holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal instrument(De Anima iii, 4). Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be attributedto the whole, as the action of the eye is attributed to a man; yet it isnever attributed to another part, except perhaps indirectly; for we do notsay that the hand sees because the eye sees. Therefore if the intellectand Socrates are united in the above manner, the action of the intellectcannot be attributed to Socrates. If, however, Socrates be a whole composedof a union of the intellect with whatever else belongs to Socrates, andstill the intellect be united to those other things only as a motor, itfollows that Socrates is not one absolutely, and consequently neither abeing absolutely, for a thing is a being according as it is one.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>There remains, therefore, no other explanation than thatgiven by Aristotle-namely, that this particular man understands, becausethe intellectual principle is his form. Thus from the very operation ofthe intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is unitedto the body as its form.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the humanspecies. For the nature of each thing is shown by its operation. Now theproper operation of man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpassesall other animals. Whence Aristotle concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that the ultimatehappiness of man must consist in this operation as properly belonging tohim. Man must therefore derive his species from that which is the principleof this operation. But the species of anything is derived from its form.It follows therefore that the intellectual principle is the proper formof man.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the moreit rises above corporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and themore it excels matter by its power and its operation; hence we find thatthe form of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its elementalqualities. And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the morewe find that the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as thevegetative soul excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excelsthe vegetative soul. Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms.Wherefore it excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it hasan operation and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever.This power is called the intellect.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soulis composed of matter and form, it would follow that in no way could thesoul be the form of the body. For since the form is an act, and matter isonly in potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot bethe form of another by virtue of itself as a whole. But if it is a formby virtue of some part of itself, then that part which is the form we callthe soul, and that of which it is the form we call the &quot;primary animate,&quot;as was said above (Q75, A5).</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii,2), the ultimate natural form to which the consideration of the naturalphilosopher is directed is indeed separate; yet it exists in matter. Heproves this from the fact that &quot;man and the sun generate man from matter.&quot;It is separate indeed according to its intellectual power, because the intellectualpower does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is theact of the eye; for understanding is an act which cannot be performed bya corporeal organ, like the act of seeing. But it exists in matter so faras the soul itself, to which this power belongs, is the form of the body,and the term of human generation. And so the Philosopher says (De Animaiii) that the intellect is separate, because it is not the faculty of acorporeal organ.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>From this it is clear how to answer the Second and ThirdObjections: since, in order that man may be able to understand all thingsby means of his intellect, and that his intellect may understand immaterialthings and universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be notthe act of the body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 4: The human soul, by reason of itsperfection, is not a form merged in matter, or entirely embraced by matter.Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the actof the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 5: The soul communicates that existencein which it subsists to the corporeal matter, out of which and the intellectualsoul there results unity of existence; so that the existence of the wholecomposite is also the existence of the soul. This is not the case with other,non-subsistent forms. For this reason the human soul retains its own existenceafter the dissolution of the body; whereas it is not so with other forms.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 6: To be united to the body belongsto the soul by reason of itself, as it belongs to a light body by reasonof it self to be raised up. And as a light body remains light, when removedfrom its proper place, retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclinationfor its proper place; so the human soul retains its proper existence whenseparated from the body, having an aptitude and a natural inclination tobe united to the body.<HR></h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Article 2: Whether the intellectual principle is multipliedaccording to the number of bodies?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that the intellectual principle is not multipliedaccording to the number of bodies, but that there is one intellect in allpersons.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For an immaterial substance is not multiplied in numberwithin one species. But the human soul is an immaterial substance; sinceit is not composed of matter and form as was shown above (Q75, A5). Thereforethere are not many human souls in one species. But all men are of one species.Therefore there is but one intellect in all men.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, when the cause is removed, the effect is alsoremoved. Therefore, if human souls were multiplied according to the numberof bodies, it follows that the bodies being removed, the number of soulswould not remain; but from all the souls there would be but a single remainder.This is heretical; for it would do away with the distinction of rewardsand punishments.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, if my intellect is distinct from your intellect,my intellect is an individual, and so is yours; for individuals are thingswhich differ in number but agree in one species. Now whatever is receivedinto anything must be received according to the condition of the receiver.Therefore the species of things would be received individually into my intellect,and also into yours: which is contrary to the nature of the intellect whichknows universals.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>4. Further, the thing understood is in the intellect whichunderstands. If, therefore, my intellect is distinct from yours, what isunderstood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you; and consequentlyit will be reckoned as something individual, and be only potentially somethingunderstood; so that the common intention will have to be abstracted fromboth; since from things diverse something intelligible common to them maybe abstracted. But this is contrary to the nature of the intellect; forthen the intellect would seem not to be distinct from the imagination. Itseems, therefore, to follow that there is one intellect in all men.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>5. Further, when the disciple receives knowledge from themaster, it cannot be said that the master's knowledge begets knowledge inthe disciple, because then also knowledge would be an active form, suchas heat is, which is clearly false. It seems, therefore, that the same individualknowledge which is in the master is communicated to the disciple; whichcannot be, unless there is one intellect in both. Seemingly, therefore,the intellect of the disciple and master is but one; and, consequently,the same applies to all men.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>6. Further, Augustine (De Quant. Animae xxxii) says: &quot;IfI were to say that there are many human souls, I should laugh at myself.&quot;But the soul seems to be one chiefly on account of the intellect. Thereforethere is one intellect of all men.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, The Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 3) thatthe relation of universal causes to universals is like the relation of particularcauses to individuals. But it is impossible that a soul, one in species,should belong to animals of different species. Therefore it is impossiblethat one individual intellectual soul should belong to several individuals.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: It is absolutely impossible for one intellectto belong to all men. This is clear if, as Plato maintained, man is theintellect itself. For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man;and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outsidethe essence of each. The distinction between Socrates and Plato would beno other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; whichis quite absurd.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, accordingto the opinion of Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), it is supposed that the intellectis a part or a power of the soul which is the form of man. For it is impossiblefor many distinct individuals to have one form, as it is impossible forthem to have one existence, for the form is the principle of existence.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may holdas to the manner of the union of the intellect to this or that man. Forit is manifest that, supposing there is one principal agent, and two instruments,we can say that there is one agent absolutely, but several actions; as whenone man touches several things with his two hands, there will be one whotouches, but two contacts. If, on the contrary, we suppose one instrumentand several principal agents, we might say that there are several agents,but one act; for example, if there be many drawing a ship by means of arope; there will be many drawing, but one pull. If, however, there is oneprincipal agent, and one instrument, we say that there is one agent andone action, as when the smith strikes with one hammer, the re is one strikerand one stroke. Now it is clear that no matter how the intellect is unitedor coupled to this or that man, the intellect has the precedence of allthe other things which appertain to man; for the sensitive powers obey theintellect, and are at its service. Therefore, if we suppose two men to haveseveral intellects and one sense-for instance, if two men had one eye-therewould be several seers, but one sight. But if there is one intellect, nomatter how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makesuse as instruments, in no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Platoare otherwise than one understanding man. And if to this we add that tounderstand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any organother than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there is butone agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one &quot;understander,&quot;and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligibleobject.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>However, it would be possible to distinguish my intellectualaction form yours by the distinction of the phantasms-that is to say, werethere one phantasm of a stone in me, and another in you-if the phantasmitself, as it is one thing in me and another in you, were a form of thepossible intellect; since the same agent according to divers forms producesdivers actions; as, according to divers forms of things with regard to thesame eye, there are divers visions. But the phantasm itself is not a formof the possible intellect; it is the intelligible species abstracted fromthe phantasm that is a form. Now in one intellect, from different phantasmsof the same species, only one intelligible species is abstracted; as appearsin one man, in whom there may be different phantasms of a stone; yet fromall of them only one intelligible species of a stone is abstracted; by whichthe intellect of that one man, by one operation, understands the natureof a stone, notwithstanding the diversity of phantasms. Therefore, if therewere one intellect for all men, the diversity of phantasms which are inthis one and that one would not cause a diversity of intellectual operationin this man and that man. It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossibleand unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: Although the intellectual soul, likean angel, has no matter from which it is produced, yet it is the form ofa certain matter; in which it is unlike an angel. Therefore, according tothe division of matter, there are many souls of one species; while it isquite impossible for many angels to be of one species.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: Everything has unity in the sameway that it has being; consequently we must judge of the multiplicity ofa thing as we judge of its being. Now it is clear that the intellectualsoul, by virtue of its very being, is united to the body as its form; yet,after the dissolution of the body, the intellectual soul retains its ownbeing. In like manner the multiplicity of souls is in proportion to themultiplicity of the bodies; yet, after the dissolution of the bodies, thesouls retain their multiplied being .</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: Individuality of the intelligentbeing, or of the species whereby it understands, does not exclude the understandingof universals; otherwise, since separate intellects are subsistent substances,and consequently individual, they could not understand universals. But themateriality of the knower, and of the species whereby it knows, impedesthe knowledge of the universal. For as every action is according to themode of the form by which the agent acts, as heating is according to themode of the heat; so knowledge is according to the mode of the species bywhich the knower knows. Now it is clear that common nature becomes distinctand multiplied by reason of the individuating principles which come fromthe matter. Therefore if the form, which is the means of knowledge, is material-thatis, not abstracted from material conditions-its likeness to the nature ofa species or genus will be ac cording to the distinction and multiplicationof that nature by means of individuating principles; so that knowledge ofthe nature of a thing in general will be impossible. But if the speciesbe abstracted from the conditions of individual matter, there will be alikeness of the nature without those things which make it distinct and multiplied;thus there will be knowledge of the universal. Nor does it matter, as tothis particular point, whether there be one intellect or many; because,even if there were but one, it would necessarily be an individual intellect,and the species whereby it understands, an individual species.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 4: Whether the intellect be one or many,what is understood is one; for what is understood is in the intellect, notaccording to its own nature, but according to its likeness; for &quot;thestone is not in the soul, but its likeness is,&quot; as is said, De Animaiii, 8. Yet it is the stone which is understood, not the likeness of thestone; except by a reflection of the intellect on itself: otherwise, theobjects of sciences would not be things, but only intelligible species.Now it happens that different things, according to different forms, arelikened to the same thing. And since knowledge is begotten according tothe assimilation of the knower to the thing known, it follows that the samething may happen to be known by several knowers; as is apparent in regardto the senses; for several see the same color, according to different likenesses.In the same way several intellects understand one object understood. Butthere is this difference, according to the opinion of Aristotle, betweenthe sense and the intelligence-that a thing is perceived by the sense accordingto the disposition which it has outside the soul-that is, in its individuality;whereas the nature of the thing understood is indeed outside the soul, butthe mode according to which it exists outside the soul is not the mode accordingto which it is understood. For the common nature is understood as apartfrom the individuating principles; whereas such is not its mode of existenceoutside the soul. But, according to the opinion of Plato, the thing understoodexists outside the soul in the same condition as those under which it isunderstood; for he supposed that the natures of things exist separate frommatter.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 5: One knowledge exists in the discipleand another in the master. How it is caused will be shown later on (Q117,A1).</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 6: Augustine denies a plurality of souls,that would involve a plurality of species.<HR>Article 3: Whether besidesthe intellectual soul there are in the person other souls essentially differentfrom one another?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that besides the intellectual soul thereare in the person other souls essentially different from one another, suchas the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. For corruptible and incorruptible are not of the samesubstance. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible; whereas the othersouls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible, as was shownabove (Q75, A6). Therefore in the person the essence of the intellectualsoul, the sensitive soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, if it be said that the sensitive soul in theperson is incorruptible; on the contrary, &quot;corruptible and incorruptiblediffer generically,&quot; says the Philosopher, Metaph. x (Did. ix, 10).But the sensitive soul in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals,is corruptible. If, therefore, in man it be incorruptible, the sensitivesoul in the person and brute animals will not be of the same &quot;genus.&quot;Now an animal is so called from its having a sensitive soul; and, therefore,&quot;animal&quot; will not be one genus common to persons and other animals,which is absurd.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, the Philosopher says, Metaph. viii (Did. vii,2), that the genus is taken from the matter, and difference from the form.But &quot;rational,&quot; which is the difference constituting the person,is taken from the intellectual soul; while he is called &quot;animal&quot;by reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive soul. Therefore theintellectual soul may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive soul,as form to matter. Therefore in man the intellectual soul is not essentiallythe same as the sensitive soul, but presupposes it as a material subject.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, It is said in the book De EcclesiasticisDogmatibus xv: &quot;Nor do we say that there are two souls in one person,as James and other Syrians write; one, animal, by which the body is animated,and which is mingled with the blood; the other, spiritual, which obeys thereason; but we say that it is one and the same soul in the person, thatboth gives life to the body by being united to it, and orders itself byits own reasoning.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: Plato held that there were several souls in onebody, distinct even as to organs, to which souls he referred the differentvital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the concupisciblein the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. Which opinion isrejected by Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts of thesoul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those animalswhich continue to live when they have been divided in each part are observedthe operations of the soul, as sense and appetite. Now this would not bethe case if the various principles of the soul's operations were essentiallydifferent, and distributed in the various parts of the body. But with regardto the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be &quot;onlylogically&quot; distinct from the other parts of the soul, &quot;or alsolocally.&quot;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>The opinion of Plato might be maintained if, as he held,the soul was supposed to be united to the body, not as its form, but asits motor. For it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thingbe moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to itsvarious parts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the bodyas its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different soulsto be in one body. This can be made clear by three different reasons.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>In the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one,in which there were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one exceptby one form, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from thesame source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominatedby various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, &quot;a whiteman.&quot; If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetativesoul, and 'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and &quot;man&quot;by another form, the intellectual soul, it would follow that man is notabsolutely one. Thus Aristotle argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), againstPlato, that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped,then a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason, against thosewho hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks (De Anima i,5), &quot;what contains them?&quot;-that is, what makes them one? It cannotbe said that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soulcontain the body and make it one, than the reverse .</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Secondly, this is proved to be impossible by the mannerin which one thing is predicated of another. Those things which are derivedfrom various forms are predicated of one another, either accidentally, (ifthe forms are not ordered to one another, as when we say that somethingwhite is sweet), or essentially, in the second manner of essential predication,(if the forms are ordered one to another, the subject belonging to the definitionof the predicate; as a surface is presupposed to color; so that if we saythat a body with a surface is colored, we have the second manner of essentialpredication.) Therefore, if we have one form by which a thing is an animal,and another form by which it is a man, it follows either that one of thesetwo things could not be predicated of the other, except accidentally, supposingthese two forms not to be ordered to one another-or that one would be predicatedof the other according to the second manner of essential predication, ifone soul be presupposed to the other. But both of these consequences areclearly false: because &quot;animal&quot; is predicated of man essentiallyand not accidentally; and man is not part of the definition of an animal,but the other way about. Therefore of necessity by the same form a thingis animal and man; otherwise man would not really be the thing which isan animal, so that animal can be essentially predicated of man.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Thirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact thatwhen one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another, which couldnever be the case unless the principle of action were essentially one.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul,the intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul.This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of speciesand forms. For we observe that the species and forms of things differ fromone another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, theanimate are more perfect than the in animate, and animals more perfect thanplants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there arevarious degrees. For this reason Aristotle, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 3),compares the species of things to numbers, which differ in species by theaddition or subtraction of unity. And (De Anima ii, 3) he compares the varioussouls to the species of figures, one of which contains another; as a pentagoncontains and exceeds a tetragon. Thus the intellectual soul contains virtuallywhatever belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals, and to the nutritivesouls of plants. Therefore, as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape,is not tetragonal by one shape, and pentagonal by another-since a tetragonalshape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal-so neither isSocrates a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the samesoul he is both animal and man.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: The sensitive soul is incorruptible,not by reason of its being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual.When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when withsensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For althoughsensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectualityof its incorruptibility.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: Not forms, but composites, are classifiedeither generically or specifically. Now man is corruptible like other animals.And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which is on the partof the forms does not involve a generic difference between man and the otheranimals.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: The embryo has first of all a soulwhich is merely sensitive, and when this is removed, it is supplanted bya more perfect soul, which is both sensitive and intellectual: as will beshown further on (Q118, A2, ad 2).</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 4: We must not consider the diversityof natural things as proceeding from the various logical notions or intentions,which flow from our manner of understanding, because reason can apprehendone and the same thing in various ways. Therefore since, as we have said,the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive soul,and something more, reason can consider separately what belongs to the powerof the sensitive soul, as something imperfect and material. And becauseit observes that this is something common to man and to other animals, itforms thence the notion of the &quot;genus&quot;; while that wherein theintellectual soul exceeds the sensitive soul, it takes as formal and perfecting;thence it gathers the &quot;difference&quot; of man.<HR>Article 4: Whetherin the person there is another form besides the intellectual soul?</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>It would seem that in the person there is another formbesides the intellectual soul. For the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1),that &quot;the soul is the act of a physical body which has life potentially.&quot;Therefore the soul is to the body as a form of matter. But the body hasa substantial form by which it is a body. Therefore some other substantialform in the body precedes the soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>2. Further, the person moves himself as every animal does.Now everything that moves itself is divided into two parts, of which onemoves, and the other is moved, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 5).But the part which moves is the soul. Therefore the other part must be suchthat it can be moved. But primary matter cannot be moved (Phys. v, 1), sinceit is a being only potentially; indeed everything that is moved is a body.Therefore in the person and in every animal there must be another substantialform, by which the body is constituted.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>3. Further, the order of forms depends on their relationto primary matter; for &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; apply bycomparison to some beginning. Therefore if there were not in the personsome other substantial form besides the rational soul, and if this wereto inhere immediately to primary matter; it would follow that it ranks amongthe most imperfect forms which inhere to matter immediately.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>4. Further, the human body is a mixed body. Now minglingdoes not result from matter alone; for then we should have mere corruption.Therefore the forms of the elements must remain in a mixed body; and theseare substantial forms. Therefore in the human body there are other substantialforms besides the intellectual soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>On the other hand, Of one thing there is but one substantialbeing. But the substantial form gives substantial being. Therefore of onething there is but one substantial form. But the soul is the substantialform of the person. Therefore it is impossible for there to be in the personanother substantial form besides the intellectual soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Response: If we suppose that the intellectual soul is notunited to the body as its form, but only as its motor, as the Platonistsmaintain, it would necessarily follow that in the person there is anothersubstantial form, by which the body is established in its being as movableby the soul. If, however, the intellectual soul be united to the body asits substantial form, as we have said above (A1), it is impossible for anothersubstantial form besides the intellectual soul to be found in the person.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>In order to make this evident, we must consider that thesubstantial form differs from the accidental form in this, that the accidentalform does not make a thing to be &quot;simply,&quot; but to be &quot;such,&quot;as heat does not make a thing to be simply, but only to be hot.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Therefore by the coming of the accidental form a thingis not said to be made or generated simply, but to be made such, or to bein some particular condition; and in like manner, when an accidental formis removed, a thing is said to be corrupted, not simply,but relatively.Now the substantial form gives being simply; therefore by its coming a thingis said to be generated simply; and by its removal to be corrupted simply.For this reason, the old natural philosophers, who held that primary matterwas some actual being-for instance, fire or air, or something of that sort-maintainedthat nothing is generated simply, or corrupted simply; and st ted that &quot;everybecoming is nothing but an alteration,&quot; as we read, Phys. i, 4. Therefore,if besides the intellectual soul there pre-existed in matter another substantialform by which the subject of the soul were made an actual being, it wouldfollow that the soul does not give being simply; and consequently that itis not the substantial form: and so at the advent of the soul there wouldnot be simple generation; nor at its removal simple corruption, all of whichis clearly false.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Whence we must conclude, that there is no other substantialform in the person besides the intellectual soul; and that the soul, asit virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive souls, so does it virtuallycontain all inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfectforms do in other things. The same is to be said of the sensitive soul inbrute animals, and of the nutritive soul in plants, and universally of allmore perfect forms with regard to the imperfect.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 1: Aristotle does not say that the soulis the act of a body only, but &quot;the act of a physical organic bodywhich has life potentially&quot;; and that this potentiality &quot;doesnot reject the soul.&quot; Whence it is clear that when the soul is calledthe act, the soul itself is included; as when we say that heat is the actof what is hot, and light of what is lucid; not as though lucid and lightwere two separate things, but because a thing is made lucid by the light.In like manner, the soul is said to be the &quot;act of a body,&quot; etc.,because by the soul it is a body, and is organic, and has life potentially.Yet the first act is said to be in potentiality to the second act, whichis operation; for such a potentiality &quot;does not reject&quot;-that is,does not exclude-the soul.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 2: The soul does not move the body byits essence, as the form of the body, but by the motive power, the act ofwhich presupposes the body to be already actualized by the soul: so thatthe soul by its motive power is the part which moves; and the animate bodyis the part moved.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 3: We observe in matter various degreesof perfection, as existence, living, sensing, and understanding. Now whatis added is always more perfect. Therefore that form which gives matteronly the first degree of perfection is the most imperfect; while that formwhich gives the first, second, and third degree, and so on, is the mostperfect: and yet it inheres to matter immediately.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Answer to argument 4: Avicenna held that the substantialforms of the elements remain entire in the mixed body; and that the mixtureis made by the contrary qualities of the elements being reduced to an average.But this is impossible, because the various forms of the elements must necessarilybe in various parts of matter; for the distinction of which we must supposedimensions, without which matter cannot be divisible. Now matter subjectto dimension is not to be found except in a body. But various bodies cannotbe in the same place. Whence it follows that elements in the mixed bodywould be distinct as to situation. And then there would not be a real mixturewhich is in respect of the whole; but only a mixture apparent to sense,by the juxtaposition of particles.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Averroes maintained that the forms of elements, by reasonof their imperfection, are a medium between accidental and substantial forms,and so can be &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot;; and therefore in themixture they are modified and reduced to an average, so that one fo rm emergesfrom them. But this is even still more impossible. For the substantial beingof each thing consists in something indivisible, and every addition andsubtraction varies the species, as in numbers, as stated in Metaph. viii(Did. vii, 3); and consequently it is impossible for any substantial formto receive &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less.&quot; Nor is it less impossiblefor anything to be a medium between substance and accident.</h1><h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Therefore we must say, in accordance with the Philosopher(De Gener. i, 10), that the forms of the elements remain in the mixed body,not actually but virtually. For the proper qualities of the elements remain,though modified; and in them is the power of the elementary forms. Thisquality of the mixture is the proper disposition for the substantial formof the mixed body; for instance, the form of a stone, or of any sort ofsoul.</h1></BODY></HTML>
