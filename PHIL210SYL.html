<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>Chinese philosophy embodies three ancient traditions: Confucianism,
Daoism, and Buddhism. Both Confucianism and Daoism are indigenous to China
while Buddhism was imported from India. This course will explore each of
these three traditions as well as their interactions and influences on major
periods of Chinese history. It will also consider the similarities and differences
between &quot;Chinese&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; conceptions of philosophy.
It is expected by the end of the semester that you know the essential features
of each tradition and be able to articulate the strengths and weaknesses
of each view.</H3>

<H3>The course will be divided into three parts. It will begin with an overview
of the background, origin, and spirit of Chinese philosophy. About three/four
weeks each will be devoted to the three &quot;schools&quot; of thought.
Each of these segments will briefly discuss the history, major works and
authors, and key ideas of the philosophical tradition. Questions to be considered
include: What are the essential features of each tradition? How are their
perspectives related? Distinct? Are they consistent? Contradictory? Are
all three perspectives necessary for a complete understanding of Chinese
thought, or does one provide a more complete or satisfactory account? How
are the three &quot;Chinese&quot; perspectives different from &quot;Western&quot;
views of reality? Which view(s) (if any) seem(s) better and why?</H3>

<H3>CHINESE PHILSOPHY AND THE HUMAN DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT:</H3>
<h3><strong>This course fulfills the Human Diversity requirement of the core curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.  According to the undergraduate catalog, courses fulfilling the human diversity requirement focus on one or more of the following areas of inquiry: racial and ethnic minorities; class; gender; marginalized groups; non- Western cultures.  Our course focuses on the last area.  As a means of satisfying the HD requirement the course will assist students in understanding the perspectives, values, experiences, works and achievements of the peoples and cultures being studied, recognizing that the experiences, beliefs, and values of any group being studied are not monolithic, but may vary widely within the group.  In this course, you will interact intellectually with people from cultures other than your own and read narratives, original work, and essays written by people from various instantiations of Chinese culture.  Our course will also consider ways in which our preconceptions, stereotypes, and assumptions affect how we understand issues related to human diversity.  Finally, we will consider ways in which our position and privilege affect our understanding of issues related to culture, diversity, and philosophy in a multi-cultural world.</strong></h3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>
<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. Students will be assigned
weekly readings from each tradition. They will be asked to participate in
an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction
paper for class each week. Class time will be devoted to discussion and
to presentations about the readings. Students will be evaluated based on
general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers,
in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a final paper.</H3>

<H3>The course will begin with a lecture format--for two weeks only. It
will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student
participation. Students will be responsible for four areas of activity:</H3>

<H3>1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion Leading,
and 4) a Final Paper or Midterm and Final Exam.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the class.
Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each week.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>2) WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS are 1 TYPED PAGE in length and are based on
the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion Area
postings for the week. Students responsible for Discussion Leading in class
will be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during that week. They will,
however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of selecting a topic/reading (by WEEK
#3), meeting with Dr. Laumakis to discuss your choice (at least one week
before your topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for
discussion on the Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion
during the class you present the issues involved in your selection.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>4) THE FINAL PAPER consists of either a synthesis of your Weekly Reaction
Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treated in them or
an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topic or theme treated
in the course. <FONT SIZE=+0>The Midterm and Final would be specified at
a later date.</FONT></H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>5) NOTE: Late papers will be penalized for each day they are late.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ATTENDANCE POLICY:</H3>

<H3>Attendance is expected. Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. Turn off your cell phones!</H3>

<H3><strong>2009 – 2010 Syllabus Statement Related to Influenza</strong></H3>
<H3><strong> (From the Office of Student Affairs via the Dean of CAS):  </strong></H3>
<H3><strong>The University of St. Thomas is committed to a healthy campus community. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there will be ongoing concerns regarding the prevalence among university faculty, staff and students of both the H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza.  To help limit the spread of these illnesses, the Centers for Disease Control has provided college campuses the following recommendation: students, faculty, or staff with influenza like illnesses (temperature of 100.0 or greater, plus a cough or sore throat) are directed to self-isolate (or stay home) for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine. In the event that students are unable to attend classes due to this self-isolation recommendation, they should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete an on-line form informing professors of their absence. In accordance, faculty will provide opportunities for these students to participate in alternative educational delivery due to this illness. </strong></H3>
<H3><strong>My Translation of the H1N1/Influenza Policy:
  
  </strong></H3>
<H3><strong>Students with influenza symptoms (temperature of 100° or greater accompanied by a cough or sore throat) should stay home from classes and minimize their contact with other people from the onset of symptoms until at least 24 hours after their fever has returned to normal without the use of fever-reducing medicine. 
  
  Students unable to attend classes due to influenza should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete the on-line form informing professors of their absence.
  
  Students who miss class due to illness are encouraged to talk to classmates about getting their lecture notes and to make an appointment with the instructor (as needed) in order to review material covered during classes they were unable to attend.
  
  In the event of a serious outbreak of influenza on campus, faculty will provide opportunities for students with flu-like illnesses to participate in alternatives to standard classroom instruction. </strong></H3>
<H3><strong>Of course, things could change depending on what the Administration says! </strong></H3>
