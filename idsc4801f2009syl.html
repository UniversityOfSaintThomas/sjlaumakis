<h2>*This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.  </h2>
<h2>2. Learning to find and use resources for answering questions and solving problems.  </h2>
<h2>*This objective will be demonstrated by students finding information relevant to their selected topic and designating readings for class discussion.  </h2>
<h2>3. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.  </h2>
<h2>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading. </h2>
<h2>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </h2>
<h2>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts.  The first part will be concerned with briefly outlining basic ethical theories and various approaches to the issues related to health and health care (Laumakis).  The second part will be concerned with the various approaches to health and health care, the basics of the current US health care system, and current indicators of health status (Carey).  The third part will focus on particular health-related issues chosen by the students.  Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings. </h2>

<h2>ASSIGNMENTS:  </h2>
<h2>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks) as we present an overview of the issues involved in health and health care.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for three areas of activity:  </h2>
<h2>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.  </h2>
<h2>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.  </h2>
<h2>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.  These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.  The papers will be evaluated on a “+/0/-“ scale.  “-“ is missing or deficient (D-F). “0” is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). “+” is a thoughtful analysis (A).  </h2>
<h2>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic.  Students will be responsible for leading discussion twice.  </h2>
<h2>ATTENDANCE POLICY:  </h2>
<h2>Attendance is expected.  Excessive absence may result in grade reduction.  Turn off your cell phones!</h2>
<h2>2009 – 2010 Syllabus Statement Related to Influenza
  (From the Office of Student Affairs via the Dean of CAS):  </h2>
<h2>The University of St. Thomas is committed to a healthy campus community. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there will be ongoing concerns regarding the prevalence among university faculty, staff and students of both the H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza.  To help limit the spread of these illnesses, the Centers for Disease Control has provided college campuses the following recommendation: students, faculty, or staff with influenza like illnesses (temperature of 100.0 or greater, plus a cough or sore throat) are directed to self-isolate (or stay home) for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine. In the event that students are unable to attend classes due to this self-isolation recommendation, they should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete an on-line form informing professors of their absence. In accordance, faculty will provide opportunities for these students to participate in alternative educational delivery due to this illness.  </h2>
<h2>Our Translation of the H1N1/Influenza Policy:  </h2>
<h2>Students with influenza symptoms (temperature of 100° or greater accompanied by a cough or sore throat) should stay home from classes and minimize their contact with other people from the onset of symptoms until at least 24 hours after their fever has returned to normal without the use of fever-reducing medicine. 
  
  Students unable to attend classes due to influenza should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete the on-line form informing professors of their absence.  </h2>
<h2>Students who miss class due to illness are encouraged to talk to classmates about getting their lecture notes and to make an appointment with the instructor (as needed) in order to review material covered during classes they were unable to attend.
  
  In the event of a serious outbreak of influenza on campus, faculty will provide opportunities for students with flu-like illnesses to participate in alternatives to standard classroom instruction. </h2>
<h2>Of course, things could change depending on what the Administration says!</h2>
<h2>GRADE DISTRIBUTION:  </h2>
<h2>Participation/Web = 30%  </h2>
<h2>Reaction Papers = 30%  </h2>
<h2>Discussion Leading (First time) = 15%  </h2>
<h2>Discussion Leading (Second time) = 15%
  Additional 10% </h2>
