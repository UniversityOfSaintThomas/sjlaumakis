<h1 ALIGN=center>Of Personal Identity<br>
  Selection from Book I, Part 4, Section 6 of A Treatise of Human Nature</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=center><br>
  SECTION VI: OF PERSONAL IDENTITY</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left><br>
  1. There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious 
  of what we call our self; that we feel its existence and its continuance in 
  existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of 
  its perfect identity and simplicity. The strongest sensation, the most violent 
  passion, say they, instead of distracting us from this view, only fix it the 
  more intensely, and make us consider their influence on self either by their 
  pain or pleasure. To attempt a further proof of this were to weaken its evidence; 
  since no proof can be derived from any fact of which we are so intimately conscious; 
  nor is there any thing of which we can be certain if we doubt of this.</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left><br>
  2. Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very experience 
  which is pleaded for them; nor have we any idea of self, after the manner it 
  is here explained. For, from what impression could this idea be derived? This 
  question it is impossible to answer without a manifest contradiction and absurdity; 
  and yet it is a question which must necessarily be answered, if we would have 
  the idea of self pass for clear and intelligible. It must be some one impression 
  that gives rise to every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression, 
  but that to which our several impressions and ideas are supposed to have a reference. 
  If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must continue 
  invariably the same, through the whole course of our lives; since self is supposed 
  to exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant and invariable. 
  Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, 
  and never all exist at the same time. It cannot therefore be from any of these 
  impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is derived; and consequently 
  there is no such idea.</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left><br>
  3. But further, what must become of all our particular perceptions upon this 
  hypothesis? All these are different, and distinguishable, and separable from 
  each other, and may be separately considered, and may exist separately, and 
  have no need of any thing to support their existence. After what manner therefore 
  do they belong to self, and how are they connected with it? For my part, when 
  I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular 
  perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or 
  pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never 
  can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for 
  any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible of myself, and may truly 
  be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions removed by death, and could 
  I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate, after the dissolution 
  of my body, I should be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is further 
  requisite to make me a perfect nonentity. If any one, upon serious and unprejudiced 
  reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I can 
  reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right 
  as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may, 
  perhaps, perceive something simple and continued, which he calls himself; though 
  I am certain there is no such principle in me.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>4. But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture 
  to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection 
  of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, 
  and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets 
  without varying our perceptions. Our thought is still more variable than our 
  sight; and all our other senses and faculties contribute to this change: nor 
  is there any single power of the soul, which remains unalterably the same, perhaps 
  for one moment. The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively 
  make their appearance; pass, repass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety 
  of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, 
  nor identity in different, whatever natural propension we may have to imagine 
  that simplicity and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead 
  us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor 
  have we the most distant notion of the place where these scenes are represented, 
  or of the materials of which it is composed.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>5. What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity 
  to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possessed of an invariable 
  and uninterrupted existence through the whole course of our lives? In order 
  to answer this question we must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it 
  regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the concern 
  we take in ourselves. The first is our present subject; and to explain it perfectly 
  we must take the matter pretty deep, and account for that identity, which we 
  attribute to plants and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt it and 
  the identity of a self or person.</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>6. We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable 
  and uninterrupted thro' a suppos'd variation of time; and this idea we call 
  that of identity or sameness. We have also a distinct idea of several different 
  objects existing in succession, and connected together by a close relation; 
  and this to an accurate view affords as perfect a notion of diversity, as if 
  there was no manner of relation among the objects. But tho' these two ideas 
  of identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves perfectly 
  distinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our common way of thinking 
  they are generally confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, 
  by which we consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which 
  we reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the same to the 
  feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought requir'd in the latter case 
  than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the mind from 
  one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it contemplated 
  one continu'd object. This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and mistake, 
  and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that of related objects. 
  However at one instant we may consider the related succession as variable or 
  interrupted, we are sure the next to ascribe to it a perfect identity, and regard 
  it as enviable and uninterrupted. Our propensity to this mistake is so great 
  from the resemblance above-mention'd, that we fall into it before we are aware; 
  and tho' we incessantly correct ourselves by reflection, and return to a more 
  accurate method of thinking, yet we cannot long sustain our philosophy, or take 
  off this biass from the imagination. Our last resource is to yield to it, and 
  boldly assert that these different related objects are in effect the same, however 
  interrupted and variable. In order to justify to ourselves this absurdity, we 
  often feign some new and unintelligible principle, that connects the objects 
  together, and prevents their interruption or variation. Thus we feign the continu'd 
  existence of the perceptions of our senses, to remove the interruption: and 
  run into the notion of a soul, and self, and substance, to disguise the variation. 
  But we may farther observe, that where we do not give rise to such a fiction, 
  our propension to confound identity with relation is so great, that we are apt 
  to imagine something unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their 
  relation; and this I take to be the case with regard to the identity we ascribe 
  to plants and vegetables. And even when this does not take place, we still feel 
  a propensity to confound these ideas, tho' we are not able fully to satisfy 
  ourselves in that particular, nor find any thing invariable and uninterrupted 
  to justify our notion of identity.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>7. Thus the controversy concerning identity is not merely a dispute 
  of words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper sense, to variable 
  or interrupted objects, our mistake is not confin'd to the expression, but is 
  commonly attended with a fiction, either of something invariable and uninterrupted, 
  or of something mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a propensity to 
  such fictions. What will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the satisfaction 
  of every fair enquirer, is to shew from daily experience and observation, that 
  the objects, which are variable or interrupted, and yet are suppos'd to continue 
  the same, are such only as consist of a succession of parts, connected together 
  by resemblance, contiguity, or causation. For as such a succession answers evidently 
  to our notion of diversity, it can only be by mistake we ascribe to it an identity; 
  and as the relation of parts, which leads us into this mistake, is really nothing 
  but a quality, which produces an association of ideas, and an easy transition 
  of the imagination from one to another, it can only be from the resemblance, 
  which this act of the mind bears to that, by which we contemplate one continu'd 
  object, that the error arises. Our chief business, then, must be to prove, that 
  all objects, to which we ascribe identity, without observing their invariableness 
  and uninterruptedness, are such as consist of a succession of related objects.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>8. In order to this, suppose any mass of matter, of which the parts 
  are contiguous and connected, to be plac'd before us; 'tis plain we must attribute 
  a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the parts continue uninterruptedly 
  and invariably the same, whatever motion or change of place we may observe either 
  in the whole or in any of the parts. But supposing some very small or inconsiderable 
  part to be added to the mass, or subtracted from it; tho' this absolutely destroys 
  the identity of the whole, strictly speaking; yet as we seldom think so accurately, 
  we scruple not to pronounce a mass of matter the same, where we find so trivial 
  an alteration. The passage of the thought from the object before the change 
  to the object after it, is so smooth and easy, that we scarce perceive the transition, 
  and are apt to imagine, that 'tis nothing but a continu'd survey of the same 
  object.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>9. There is a very remarkable circumstance, that attends this experiment; 
  which is, that tho' the change of any considerable part in a mass of matter 
  destroys the identity of the whole, let we must measure the greatness of the 
  part, not absolutely, but by its proportion to the whole. The addition or diminution 
  of a mountain wou'd not be sufficient to produce a diversity in a planet: tho' 
  the change of a very few inches wou'd be able to destroy the identity of some 
  bodies. 'Twill be impossible to account for this, but by reflecting that objects 
  operate upon the mind, and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions 
  not according to their real greatness, but according to their proportion to 
  each other: And therefore, since this interruption makes an object cease to 
  appear the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress of the thought, which 
  constitutes the imperfect identity.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>10. This may be confirm'd by another phenomenon. A change in any 
  considerable part of a body destroys its identity; but 'tis remarkable, that 
  where the change is produc'd gradually and insensibly we are less apt to ascribe 
  to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no other, than that the mind, 
  in following the successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage from 
  the surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and 
  at no particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which 
  continu'd perception, it ascribes a continu'd existence and identity to the 
  object.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>11. But whatever precaution we may use in introducing the changes 
  gradually, and making them proportionable to the whole, 'tis certain, that where 
  the changes are at last observ'd to become considerable, we make a scruple of 
  ascribing identity to such different objects. There is, however, another artifice, 
  by which we may induce the imagination to advance a step farther; and that is, 
  by producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to some 
  common end or purpose. A ship, of which a considerable part has been chang'd 
  by frequent reparations, is still considered as the same; nor does the difference 
  of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it. The common end, 
  in which the parts conspire, is the same under all their variations, and affords 
  an easy transition of the imagination from one situation of the body to another.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>12. But this is still more remarkable, when we add a sympathy of 
  parts to their common end, and suppose that they bear to each other, the reciprocal 
  relation of cause and effect in all their actions and operations. This is the 
  case with all animals and vegetables; where not only the several parts have 
  a reference to some general purpose, but also a mutual dependence on, and connexion 
  with each other. The effect of so strong a relation is, that tho' every one 
  must allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and animals endure a total 
  change, yet we still attribute identity to them, while their form, size, and 
  substance are entirely alter'd. An oak, that grows from a small plant to a large 
  tree, is still the same oak; tho' there be not one particle of matter, or figure 
  of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man, and is sometimes fat, sometimes 
  lean, without any change in his identity.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>13. We may also consider the two following phaenomena, which are 
  remarkable in their kind. The first is, that tho' we commonly be able to distinguish 
  pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet it sometimes happens, 
  that we confound them, and in our thinking and reasoning employ the one for 
  the other. Thus a man, who hears a noise, that is frequently interrupted and 
  renew'd, says, it is still the same noise; tho' 'tis evident the sounds have 
  only a specific identity or resemblance, and there is nothing numerically the 
  same, but the cause, which produc'd them. In like manner it may be said without 
  breach of the propriety of language, that such a church, which was formerly 
  of brick, fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church of free-stone, 
  and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor materials are 
  the same, nor is there any thing common to the two objects, but their relation 
  to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet this alone is sufficient to make us 
  denominate them the same. But we must observe, that in these cases the first 
  object is in a manner annihilated before the second comes into existence; by 
  which means, we are never presented in any one point of time with the idea of 
  difference and multiplicity: and for that reason are less scrupulous in calling 
  them the same.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>14. Secondly, We may remark, that tho' in a succession of related 
  objects, it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden 
  nor entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are in 
  their nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden transition, 
  than wou'd otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus as the nature of 
  a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and 
  twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing 
  the same during several ages. What is natural and essential to any thing is, 
  in a manner, expected; and what is expected makes less impression, and appears 
  of less moment, than what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change 
  of the former kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial 
  alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the thought, 
  has less influence in destroying the identity.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>15. We now proceed to explain the nature of personal identity, 
  which has become so great a question in philosophy, especially of late years 
  in England, where all the abstruser sciences are study'd with a peculiar ardour 
  and application. And here 'tis evident, the same method of reasoning must be 
  continu'd. which has so successfully explain'd the identity of plants, and animals, 
  and ships, and houses, and of all the compounded and changeable productions 
  either of art or nature. The identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, 
  is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables 
  and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed 
  from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>16. But lest this argument shou'd not convince the reader; tho' 
  in my opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning, which 
  is still closer and more immediate. 'Tis evident, that the identity, which we 
  attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not 
  able to run the several different perceptions into one, and make them lose their 
  characters of distinction and difference, which are essential to them. 'Tis 
  still true, that every distinct perception, which enters into the composition 
  of the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and distinguishable, 
  and separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive. 
  But, as, notwithstanding this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole 
  train of perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises concerning 
  this relation of identity; whether it be something that really binds our several 
  perceptions together, or only associates their ideas in the imagination. That 
  is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the identity of a person, 
  we observe some real bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the 
  ideas we form of them. This question we might easily decide, if we wou'd recollect 
  what has been already prov'd at large, that the understanding never observes 
  any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cause and effect, 
  when strictly examin'd, resolves itself into a customary association of ideas. 
  For from thence it evidently follows, that identity is nothing really belonging 
  to these different perceptions, and uniting them together; but is merely a quality, 
  which we attribute to them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, 
  when we reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union 
  in the imagination, are these three relations above-mention'd. These are the 
  uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them every distinct object 
  is separable by the mind, and may be separately considered, and appears not 
  to have any more connexion with any other object, than if disjoin'd by the greatest 
  difference and remoteness. 'Tis, therefore, on some of these three relations 
  of resemblance, contiguity and causation, that identity depends; and as the 
  very essence of these relations consists in their producing an easy transition 
  of ideas; it follows, that our notions of personal identity, proceed entirely 
  from the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought along a train of connected 
  ideas, according to the principles above-explain'd.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>17. The only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what relations 
  this uninterrupted progress of our thought is produc'd, when we consider the 
  successive existence of a mind or thinking person. And here 'tis evident we 
  must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and must drop contiguity, 
  which has little or no influence in the present case.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>18. To begin with resemblance; suppose we cou'd see clearly into 
  the breast of another, and observe that succession of perceptions, which constitutes 
  his mind or thinking principle, and suppose that he always preserves the memory 
  of a considerable part of past perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing cou'd 
  more contribute to the bestowing a relation on this succession amidst all its 
  variations. For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images 
  of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily resembles its object, must 
  not the frequent placing of these resembling perceptions in the chain of thought, 
  convey the imagination more easily from one link to another, and make the whole 
  seem like the continuance of one object? In this particular, then, the memory 
  not only discovers the identity, but also contributes to its production, by 
  producing the relation of resemblance among the perceptions. The case is the 
  same whether we consider ourselves or others.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>19. As to causation; we may observe, that the true idea of the 
  human mind, is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or different 
  existences, which are link'd together by the relation of cause and effect, and 
  mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other. Our impressions 
  give rise to their correspondent ideas; and these ideas in their turn produce 
  other impressions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a third, by 
  which it is expell'd in its turn. In this respect, I cannot compare the soul 
  more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the 
  several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination, 
  and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant 
  changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change 
  its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person 
  may vary his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, 
  without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several parts 
  are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view our identity 
  with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, 
  by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us 
  a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>20. As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent 
  of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be considered, upon that account 
  chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd 
  have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, 
  which constitute our self or person. But having once acquir'd this notion of 
  causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes, and consequently 
  the identity of our persons beyond our memory, and can comprehend times, and 
  circumstances, and actions, which we have entirely forgot, but suppose in general 
  to have existed. For how few of our past actions are there, of which we have 
  any memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts and actions 
  on the 1st of January 1715, the 11th of March 1719, and the 3rd of August 1733? 
  Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot the incidents of these days, 
  that the present self is not the same person with the self of that time; and 
  by that means overturn all the most established notions of personal identity? 
  In this view, therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal 
  identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different 
  perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on those, who affirm that memory produces entirely 
  our personal identity, to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity 
  beyond our memory.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>21. The whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which 
  is of great importance in the present affair, viz. that all the nice and subtile 
  questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be decided, and are 
  to be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical difficulties. Identity 
  depends on the relations of ideas; and these relations produce identity, by 
  means of that easy transition they occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness 
  of the transition may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard, 
  by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they acquire or 
  lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning the identity 
  of connected objects are merely verbal, except so far as the relation of parts 
  gives rise to some fiction or imaginary principle of union, as we have already 
  observed.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>22. What I have said concerning the first origin and uncertainty 
  of our notion of identity, as apply'd to the human mind, may be extended with 
  little or no variation to that of simplicity. An object, whose different co-existent 
  parts are bound together by a close relation, operates upon the imagination 
  after much the same manner as one perfectly simple and indivisible and requires 
  not a much greater stretch of thought in order to its conception. From this 
  similarity of operation we attribute a simplicity to it, and feign a principle 
  of union as the support of this simplicity, and the center of all the different 
  parts and qualities of the object.<br>
  Thus we have finish'd our examination of the several systems of philosophy, 
  both of the intellectual and natural world; and in our miscellaneous way of 
  reasoning have been led into several topics; which will either illustrate and 
  confirm some preceding part of this discourse, or prepare the way for our following 
  opinions. 'Tis now time to return to a more close examination of our subject, 
  and to proceed in the accurate anatomy of human nature, having fully explain'd 
  the nature of our judgment and understandings.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left><br>
  Selection from Appendix of A Treatise of Human Nature on Personal Identity<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left><br>
  I had entertain'd some hopes, that however deficient our theory of the intellectual 
  world might be, it wou'd be free from those contradictions, and absurdities, 
  which seem to attend every explication, that human reason can give of the material 
  world. But upon a more strict review of the section concerning personal identity, 
  I find myself involv'd in such a labyrinth, that, I must confess, I neither 
  know how to correct my former opinions, nor how to render them consistent. If 
  this be not a good general reason for scepticism, `tis at least a sufficient 
  one (if I were not already abundantly supplied) for me to entertain a diffidence 
  and modesty in all my decisions. I shall propose the arguments on both sides, 
  beginning with those that induc'd me to deny the strict and proper identity 
  and simplicity of a self or thinking being.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>When we talk of self or substance, we must have an idea annex'd 
  to these terms, otherwise they are altogether unintelligible. Every idea is 
  deriv'd from preceding impressions; and we have no impression of self or substance, 
  as something simple and individual. We have, therefore, no idea of them in that 
  sense.<br>
  Whatever is distinct, is distinguishable; and whatever is distinguishable, is 
  separable by the thought or imagination. All perceptions are distinct. They 
  are, therefore, distinguishable, and separable, and may be conceiv'd as separately 
  existent, and may exist separately, without any contradiction or absurdity.<br>
  When I view this table and that chimney, nothing is present to me but particular 
  perceptions, which are of a like nature with all the other perceptions. This 
  is the doctrine of philosophers. But this table, which is present to me, and 
  the chimney, may and do exist separately. This is the doctrine of the vulgar, 
  and implies no contradiction. There is no contradiction, therefore, in extending 
  the same doctrine to all the perceptions.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>In general, the following reasoning seems satisfactory. All ideas 
  are borrow'd from preceding perceptions. Our ideas of objects, therefore, are 
  deriv'd from that source. Consequently no proposition can be intelligible or 
  consistent with regard to objects, which is not so with regard to perceptions. 
  But `tis intelligible and consistent to say, that objects exist distinct and 
  independent, without any common simple substance or subject of inhesion. This 
  proposition, therefore, can never be absurd with regard to perceptions.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>When I turn my reflection on myself, I never can perceive this 
  self without some one or more perceptions; nor can I ever perceive any thing 
  but the perceptions. Tis the composition of these, therefore, which forms the 
  self. We can conceive a thinking being to have either many or few perceptions. 
  Suppose the mind to be reduc'd even below the life of an oyster. Suppose it 
  to have only one perception, as of thirst or hunger. Consider it in that situation. 
  Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception? Have you any notion of 
  self or substance? If not, the addition of other perceptions can never give 
  you that notion.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>The annihilation, which some people suppose to follow upon death, 
  and which entirely destroys this self, is nothing but an extinction of all particular 
  perceptions; love and hatred, pain and pleasure, thought and sensation. These 
  therefore must be the same with self; since the one cannot survive the other.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>Is self the same with substance? If it be, how can that question 
  have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance? 
  If they be distinct, what is the difference betwixt them? For my part, I have 
  a notion of neither, when conceiv'd distinct from particular perceptions.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>Philosophers begin to be reconcil'd to the principle, that we have 
  no idea of external substance, distinct from the ideas of particular qualities. 
  This must pave the way for a like principle with regard to the mind, that we 
  have no notion of it, distinct from the particular perceptions.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>So far I seem to be attended with sufficient evidence. But having 
  thus loosen'd all our particular perceptions, when(23) I proceed to explain 
  the principle of connexion, which binds them together, and makes us attribute 
  to them a real simplicity and identity; I am sensible, that my account is very 
  defective, and that nothing but the seeming evidence of the precedent reasonings 
  cou'd have induc'd me to receive it. If perceptions are distinct existences, 
  they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among 
  distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding. We only feel 
  a connexion or determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. 
  It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when 
  reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas 
  of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. 
  However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most 
  philosophers seem inclin'd to think, that personal identity arises from consciousness; 
  and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present 
  philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, 
  when I come to explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions 
  in our thought or consciousness. I cannot discover any theory, which gives me 
  satisfaction on this head.<br>
</h1>
<h1 ALIGN=left>In short there are two principles, which I cannot render consistent; 
  nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz, that all our distinct 
  perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real 
  connexion among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either inhere in something 
  simple and individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them, 
  there wou'd be no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege 
  of a sceptic, and confess, that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding. 
  I pretend not, however, to pronounce it absolutely insuperable. Others, perhaps, 
  or myself, upon more mature reflections, may discover some hypothesis, that 
  will reconcile those contradictions. </h1>
