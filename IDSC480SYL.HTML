<H2>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H2>

<H3>The disciplines of philosophy and psychology have always been closely
aligned, and have traditionally been concerned with specifying the nature
of mind and human knowledge. In fact, philosophy (along with physiology/biology)
is considered a &quot;parent&quot; discipline of psychology. However, at
the same time, psychology is often contrasted with philosophy in terms of
the distinct methodologies it uses for investigating issues of mind. For
example, psychology tends to take an empirical approach, attempting to delineate
the workings of the mind through controlled observation and experimentation.
Philosophy, on the other hand, is generally identified with a rationalistic
or more theoretical approach to questions the mind and knowing. Nevertheless,
the roots of contemporary scientific psychology can be traced to a host
of what might be termed &quot;scientific philosophers&quot; (such as Democritus,
Aristotle, and Aquinas) who believed that the functions of the human mind
in knowing reality could be explained in a clear and deterministic fashion.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>This seminar will explore attempts by philosophers and cognitive psychologists
to specify the nature of mind, human knowledge, and the activity of representing
reality. The course will be organized topically, focusing on specific cognitive
activities or faculties and their theoretical understanding, including:
sensation and perception, memory processes, mental imagery and object representation,
intelligence and knowledge questions, and the connections between philosophy
and psychology. Questions to be considered include: How do the perspectives
of philosophy and psychology inform us about these topics? How are these
perspectives related? Distinct? Are they consistent? Contradictory? Are
both perspectives necessary for complete understanding, or does one provide
a more complete or satisfactory account? Readings will include primary and
secondary sources from each discipline. Students will be evaluated based
on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers,
in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a final project/paper.</H3>

<H2>ASSIGNMENTS:</H2>

<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to
the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose
distressing questions, and just plain make you think. The course will begin
with a lecture format (roughly 4 weeks) as we present an overview of Philosophy
of Knowledge and Cognitive Psychology. It will then proceed in seminar style
with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation. Students will be responsible
for four areas of activity: 1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers,
3) Discussion Leading, and 4) a Final Project/Paper.</H3>

<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings
and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.
Students MUST post at least one reaction to the readings each week.</H3>

<H3>2) WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS are 1 TYPED PAGE in length and are based on
the pre-assigned readings or some aspect of the Threaded Discussion Area
postings for the week. Students responsible for Discussion Leading in class
will be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during those two weeks. They
will, however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</H3>

<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 3 students (by
WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), meeting with Dr. Robinson-Riegler
&amp; Dr. Laumakis to select readings (at least two weeks before your topic
is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion on the
Web prior to your discussions, and leading class discussion during the two
weeks you present the philosophical (week 1) and psychological (week 2)
issues involved in your topic.</H3>

<H3>4) THE FINAL PROJECT/PAPER consists of either a synthesis of your Weekly
Reaction Papers into a coherent account of some topic or theme treated in
them or an extended (5? page) discussion and evaluation of some topic or
theme treated in the seminar. Late papers will be penalized one full grade
for each day they are late.</H3>
