Technically, VALIDITY is thestructural feature of an argument concerned with whether the PREMISES logicallylead to or support the CONCLUSION. In short, an argument's VALIDITY is determinedby the form/structure of the syllogism. As such, the VALIDITY of an argumentcan be determined independent of the truth of the PREMISES and CONCLUSIONof the argument. In other words, an INVALID argument contains PREMISES thatdo not logically support the CONCLUSION.</h2><h2>Another way of capturing the concept of VALIDITY is to say that a VALIDargument is one in which you CANNOT accept the PREMISES as true and denythe CONCLUSION without contradicting yourself. In other words, a VALID syllogismcannot have true premises and a false conclusion. However, be aware thatVALID syllogisms may have false premises and/or a false conclusion, andan argument whose premises and conclusion are all true may neverthelessbe INVALID.</h2><h2>Recall that CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISMS have a STANDARD FORM:</h2><h2>P1--ALL M IS P.</h2><h2>P2--ALL S IS M.</h2><h2>C-- ALL S IS P.</h2><h2>The SUBJECT of the CONCLUSION is called the Minor Term. The PREDICATEof the CONCLUSION is called the Major Term. P1 is called the Major Premise(because it contains the Major Term), and P2 is called the Minor Premise(because it contains the Minor Term). M is the Middle or Linking Term. TheRULES of VALIDITY are based on the form of the syllogism and the terms init.</h2><h2>The shortest and perhaps easiest set of RULES for testing the VALIDITYof a CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISM is as follows:</h2><h2>1. The MIDDLE TERM (M) must be DISTRIBUTED in at least one premise. Ifnot, the argument is INVALID.</h2><h2>2. IF a term is DISTRIBUTED in the CONCLUSION, then it must be DISTRIBUTEDin the PREMISE in which it occurs.</h2><h2>3. The PREMISES cannot both be NEGATIVE (i.e., E or O Propositions).</h2><h2>4. IF one PREMISE is NEGATIVE, then the CONCLUSION must be NEGATIVE.</h2><h2>5. IF the CONCLUSION is NEGATIVE, one PREMISE must be NEGATIVE.</h2><h2>One last thing--DISTRIBUTION is a feature of the SUBJECT and PREDICATETERMS in a CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISM. The SUBJECT or PREDICATE TERM is saidto be DISTRIBUTED when it refers to ALL the members of the class of thingsfor which it stands. If the term does NOT refer to ALL the members of theclass for which it stands, then the term is NOT DISTRIBUTED or UNDISTRIBUTED.</h2><h2>The DISTRIBUTION of terms in standard form categorical syllogisms isas follows:</h2><h2>1. All S is P. (A)-S is DISTRIBUTED and P is NOT DISTRIBUTED--(ObviouslyALL the S's are being referred to, but it DOES NOT refer to all the P's)</h2><h2>2. No S is P. (E)-S is DISTRIBUTED and P is DISTRIBUTED--(ALL the S'sare unrelated to ALL the P's)</h2><h2>3. Some S is P. (I)-NEITHER S nor P is DISTRIBUTED--(Obviously SOME Sis not ALL S and P DOES NOT refer to all the P's)</h2><h2>4. Some S is not P. (O)-S is NOT DISTRIBUTED and P is DISTRIBUTED--(Atleast one S has nothing to do with ALL the P's)</h2></BODY></HTML>
