<h3><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u>:</h3>
<h3>As an introduction to philosophy, this course (1) enquires into the foundations of ethics, by (2) considering how our conception of the human person affects our understanding of the good human life. It also (3) considers the question of the rationality of belief in God and the difference (if any) God&rsquo;s existence makes to our understanding of the person and the good. In addressing each of these topics, the course (4) develops and applies basic logical and critical thinking skills, introduced as an essential part of philosophical method. </h3>
<h3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to the nature of the human person, ethics, and the existence of God--using philosophical methodology, and with substantial attention to Catholic intellectual tradition. It is expected by the end of the semester that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of the human person and the good human life.</h3>
