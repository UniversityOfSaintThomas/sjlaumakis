<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:
  
  This seminar will focus on the nature and experiences of religious and philosophical conversions.  We will explore the concept of conversion by reading first-hand accounts of those who have undergone conversion experiences.  We will then consider the similarities and differences between religious and philosophical conversions and how each is related to the more general question of how one goes about finding one’s way in life.  </H3>
<H3>In general, we are interested in exploring the similarities and differences between philosophical conversions and religious conversions—and how these forms of conversion relate to religious and philosophical questions about the meaning and purpose of life.  We are also interested in the ethical and moral dimensions of conversions insofar as they impact the actions and lifestyles of those who undergo a conversion.  In order to focus our discussion we will read first-hand 
  accounts of conversions and then consider the overarching theme of finding one’s way in life—as both a philosophical and religious pursuit.  </H3>
<H3>Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, reaction papers, and in-class presentations and discussion leading.  </H3>

<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </H3>
<H3>The seminar will be divided into roughly two parts.  </H3>
<H3>The first part will be concerned with etymological and analytical questions about the definitions of ‘conversion,’ ‘philosophical conversion’ and ‘religious conversion’—and, more generally, with what it means to “find one’s way in life.”  </H3>
<H3>The second part will be concerned with a close reading of various first-hand accounts of conversions, as well other second-hand accounts.  This part will consider the ethical and moral dimensions of conversions and how they lead to lifestyle changes in those who have undergone conversion experiences.  This part will provide an opportunity for students to reflect on their own ongoing efforts to “find their way in life.”  </H3>
<H3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line 
  discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one/two-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the 
  readings.  </H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:  </H3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two weeks--at most) as we present an overview of the Theological and Philosophical issues involved in the question of conversion.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for three areas of activity:  </H3>
<H3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.  </H3>
<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.  </H3>
<H3>2) REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.  These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.  The papers will be evaluated on a “+/0/-“ scale.  “-“ is missing or deficient (D-F). “0” is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). “+” is a thoughtful analysis (A).  </H3>
<H3>3) DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic.  Students will be responsible for leading discussion three times.  </H3>
