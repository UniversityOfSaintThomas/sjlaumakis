<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS:</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>As an introduction to philosophy, the course will focus on the fundamental
conceptions of the nature of the human person in ancient, medieval, modern,
and contemporary philosophy. It will also include the development of basic
logical and critical thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background
for future reflections on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject
matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting
the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to
the nature of the human person. It is expected by the end of the semester
that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and
be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of
the human person.</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>REQUIRED TEXTS:</H3>

<H3>WESTON, A RULEBOOK FOR ARGUMENTS</H3>

<H3>DIVERSITY READINGS--PACKET FROM UST BOOKSTORE &amp; SELECTED HANDOUTS</H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:</H3>

<H3>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental philosophical notions. &nbsp; Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. &nbsp; There will be 12 "weekly" quizzes on pre-assigned readings, class lectures, and other extra credit opportunities--your best 10 quizzes will count and there are <strong>NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES </strong>. &nbsp; There will also be 4 TESTS throughout the semester. &nbsp; Make-up TESTS are possible <strong>ONLY UNDER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES </strong> (i.e., your near-death or other kinds of serious illness that would involve a note from your doctor, a family or parenting-related emergency, or a UST-sponsored event--early purchase of an airline ticket does not count as such an excuse!). &nbsp; If you need to schedule a make-up you should see me <strong>ASAP </strong> to see if your situation meets the conditions under which a make-up may be taken. Make-up TESTS are completely different from regular tests and typically all-essay. </H3>

<h3>ATTENDANCE POLICY : </h3>
<h3>Attendance is expected. &nbsp; Failure to attend class is a <strong>VERY SERIOUS MATTER </strong>! Excessive absence may result in grade reduction. &nbsp; <strong>Turn off your cell phones!</strong></h3>
<h3>2009 – 2010 Syllabus Statement Related to Influenza
  (From the Office of Student Affairs via the Dean of CAS):</h3>
<h3> The University of St. Thomas is committed to a healthy campus community. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there will be ongoing concerns regarding the prevalence among university faculty, staff and students of both the H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza.  To help limit the spread of these illnesses, the Centers for Disease Control has provided college campuses the following recommendation: students, faculty, or staff with influenza like illnesses (temperature of 100.0 or greater, plus a cough or sore throat) are directed to self-isolate (or stay home) for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine. In the event that students are unable to attend classes due to this self-isolation recommendation, they should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete an on-line form informing professors of their absence. In accordance, faculty will provide opportunities for these students to participate in alternative educational delivery due to this illness.  </h3>
<h3>My Translation of the H1N1/Influenza Policy:  </h3>
<h3>Students with influenza symptoms (temperature of 100° or greater accompanied by a cough or sore throat) should stay home from classes and minimize their contact with other people from the onset of symptoms until at least 24 hours after their fever has returned to normal without the use of fever-reducing medicine. 
  
  Students unable to attend classes due to influenza should consult the university’s pandemic web site http://www.stthomas.edu/pandemic/plan/default.html and complete the on-line form informing professors of their absence.  </h3>
<h3>Students who miss class due to illness are encouraged to talk to classmates about getting their lecture notes and to make an appointment with the instructor (as needed) in order to review material covered during classes they were unable to attend.
  
  In the event of a serious outbreak of influenza on campus, faculty will provide opportunities for students with flu-like illnesses to participate in alternatives to standard classroom instruction.</h3>
<h3>Of course, things could change depending on what the Administration says! </h3>
