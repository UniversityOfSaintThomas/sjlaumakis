<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Sports seem to occupy a special place in American Culture. Major sporting events are regularly the highest rated television programs and tickets for those events routinely sell out. Why are sports such a huge part of our culture? &nbsp;</h3>
<h3>This seminar will examine the philosophy of sports, why we play sports and games, what meaning we derive from them and what role they should play in a well-ordered society. &nbsp;It will also examine the intersection of sports and law as it relates to how society regulates sports. What laws do we impose on sports? Do the teams and athletes involved in sports receive special treatment in our legal system?&nbsp; These and other related questions and topics will be discussed in this seminar.</h3>
<h3>Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, reaction papers, and in-class discussion leading. </h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR OBJECTIVES</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>1. Gaining a basic understanding of the subject (i.e., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories).</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>2. To acquire skills in working with others as a member of a team.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by successful class discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>3. Developing skill in expressing oneself orally and in writing.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3>4. Learning to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view.</h3>
<h3>*This objective will be demonstrated by reaction papers, class participation, and discussion leading.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>SEMINAR STRUCTURE</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly two parts.&nbsp; </h3>
<h3>Initial classroom presentations by the professors&mdash;in the first part&mdash;will lay the groundwork for students to discover and develop their own presentations about philosophical and legal issues related to sports&mdash;in the second part.&nbsp; Discussions, based on the Spengler text and the Journal of the Philosophy of Sport, will strengthen their analytic skills and their knowledge of philosophical and legal matters related to sports.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line <br>
  discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week (10 total).&nbsp; Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.&nbsp; Students are expected to devote about 3-4 hours of study each week to this seminar.</h3>
<h3>We realize that we live in the age of social media and constant connectivity.&nbsp; A seminar style, however, relies on effective communication skills from all involved.&nbsp; That means not only effectively presenting your ideas, but also listening attentively to others.&nbsp; To listen effectively you need to disconnect from e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, web surfing and other digital distractions during class time.&nbsp; If you bring a laptop or tablet to class it should be used only for class related activities.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>TEXTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Spengler, John O., et. Al., (2016).&nbsp;<u>Introduction to Sport Law (2nd Edition)</u>.</h3>
<h3><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</h3>
<h3>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.&nbsp; The seminar will begin with a lecture format (two-four weeks&mdash;at most) as we present an overview of the philosophical and legal issues related to each aspect of sports.&nbsp; It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation.&nbsp; Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </h3>
<h3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.</h3>
<h3>1) <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar.</h3>
<h3>2)<strong> REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1-2 TYPED PAGE(S)</u> in length and are based on pre-assigned readings.&nbsp; These ten (10) papers involve a critical analysis/reflection on the texts.&nbsp; The papers will be evaluated on a 1-5 scale.&nbsp; &ldquo;1&ldquo;is missing or deficient (D-F). &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A).</h3>
<h3>3) <strong>DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of forming a group of 2-3 students (by WEEK #2-3), selecting a topic (by WEEK #2-3), and leading class discussion during the week you present the issues involved in your topic.&nbsp; Students will be responsible for leading discussion two times.</h3>
