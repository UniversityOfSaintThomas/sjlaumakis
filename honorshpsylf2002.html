<P><B>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</B>:</P>

<P>As an introduction to philosophy, the course will focus on the fundamental
conceptions of the nature of the human person in ancient, medieval, modern,
and contemporary philosophy. It will also include the development of basic
logical and critical thinking skills. Finally, it will provide a background
for future reflections on the way we ought to live our lives--the subject
matter of Ethics--Phil. 214.</P>

<P>The aim of the course is to introduce you to philosophy by presenting
the questions and answers that philosophers think about with respect to
the nature of the human person. It is expected by the end of the semester
that you know something of the thought of several major philosophers and
be able to articulate coherently your own understanding of the nature of
the human person.</P>

<P>Since this is a basic, introductory course emphasizing the understanding
of elementary ideas, you are asked to concentrate on learning these fundamental
philosophical notions. Reading of assigned texts is a MUST in order to introduce
you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation,
pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think. There will be
2 SHORT PAPERS (2-3 typed pages in length and NOT MORE THAN 4 TYPED PAGES)
on pre-assigned readings. At least 1 paper will be presented to the class
along with a 1 page summary/outline of the paper for the other members of
the class. There will also be 2 EXAMS--a Mid-Term Exam and a Final Exam
at the end of the semester.</P>
