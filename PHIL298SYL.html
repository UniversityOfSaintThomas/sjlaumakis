<p><strong><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION/GOALS</u></strong>:</p>
<p>This course in the history and development of Buddhism will be divided into three parts.  After an introductory overview we will begin with Buddhism in India by looking at the earliest teachings and doctrines of the Buddha and their relationship to the basic beliefs and practices of Hinduism. Second, we will trace the subsequent development of the different schools of Buddhist thought in China.  Particular attention will be given to the teachings of Bodhidharma and Huineng and their connection to traditional Buddhism.  Finally, we will focus on two types of Japanese Buddhism: Zen and Pure Land Buddhism.  Throughout the course we will be concerned with both the cultural and historical transformations of Buddhism as well as its relevance as a source of meaning and insight about the nature of reality. </p>

<p><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong>:</p>
<p>Reading of assigned materials is a <u>MUST</u> in order to introduce you to the subject matter, facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  Students will be assigned weekly readings from each tradition.  They will be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to presentations about the readings.  Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading, and a midterm and final paper.</p>
<p>The course will begin with a lecture format--for two weeks only.  It will then proceed in seminar style with <u>SIGNIFICANT</u> emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for five areas of activity: <br>
  1) Participation, 2) Weekly Reaction Papers, 3) Discussion Leading, 4) A Midterm Paper, and 5) a Final Paper</p>
<p><strong>1) PARTICIPATION</strong> includes class discussion of the assigned readings and/or Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the class.  Students <u>MUST</u> post at least one reaction to the readings each week.</p>
<p><strong>2) WEEKLY REACTION PAPERS</strong> are <u>1 TYPED PAGE</u> in length and are based on the pre-assigned readings.  Students responsible for Discussion Leading in class will be exempt from the Weekly Reaction Papers during that week.  They will, however, be responsible for significant Web postings.</p>
<p><strong>3) DISCUSSION LEADING</strong> consists of selecting a topic/reading (by WEEK #3), meeting with Dr. Laumakis to discuss your choice (at least one week before your topic is to be discussed), posting questions and comments for discussion on the Web prior to your discussion, and leading class discussion during the class you present the issues involved in your selection.</p>
<p><strong>4) THE MIDTERM PAPER </strong>is a response to this question: What is the most basic/important teaching of the Buddha and why?  This (3-5 page) paper will justify your own understanding of the most essential teaching of the Buddha.</p>
<p><strong>5) THE FINAL PAPER</strong> is a comparative paper and is a reflection on the semester long practice of considering &ldquo;WWBD?&rdquo;  This (5-10 page) paper will be concerned with the differences between WWBD and what one would normally do.  It should begin with an account of your own Noble Truths and Path and compare this with the Buddha&rsquo;s.  Finally, it should include an assessment of what the Buddha got right and what he got wrong and why.</p>
<p><strong>6) NOTE</strong>: <strong>Late papers will be penalized for each day they are late.</strong><strong> </strong><br>
