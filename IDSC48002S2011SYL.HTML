<H3>SEMINAR DESCRIPTION/GOALS:  </H3>
<H3>This seminar will consider the question of the nature of Buddhism in its various expressions, particularly in terms of whether it is a philosophy, a religion, or some other expression of 
human wisdom and flourishing.  In order to clarify this issue we will consider how Western philosophical and religious models influence one’s interpretation of non-Western expressions.  We will also investigate the history and development of forms of Buddhism—their texts and practices—as Buddhism moved from India into Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Tibet, and the West.</H3>
<H3>In general, we are interested in exploring how our Western philosophical and religious categories affect our understanding of Eastern philosophical/religious beliefs and practices.  As a consequence, the seminar will consider the questions of whether ‘Buddhism’ designates a 
  single or complex thing, and whether it is a philosophy, religion, both, or neither, and indeed 
  whether mutual belonging is possible as some have claimed.  In order to clarify and focus the questions we will consider the definitions and conceptions of ‘philosophy’ and ‘religion’ in both the East and the West. </H3>

<H3>SEMINAR STRUCTURE:  </H3>
<h3>The seminar will be divided into roughly three parts.  The first part will be concerned with clarifying and distinguishing ‘philosophy, ‘theology,’ and ‘religion.’  It will also consider the nature of the relationship between “faith” and “reason.”  The second part will be concerned with investigating Buddhism as philosophy—with special attention given to its ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics.  The third part will investigate Buddhism as religion—with special attention given to its various forms as it moved from India into Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Tibet, and the West.  </h3>
<h3>Students will be assigned weekly readings, and be asked to participate in an on-line discussion of the readings as well as prepare a one-page reaction paper for class each week.  Class time will be devoted to discussion and to student presentations based on the readings.  Students will be evaluated based on general class discussion and participation, short weekly reaction papers, in-class presentations and discussion leading. </h3>

<H3>ASSIGNMENTS:  </H3>
<H3>Reading of assigned materials is a MUST in order to introduce you to the subject matter, 
facilitate class discussion and participation, pose distressing questions, and just plain make you think.  The seminar will begin with a discussion of Fides et Ratio and a general investigation of the similarities and differences between philosophy and theology/religion.  It will then proceed in seminar style with SIGNIFICANT emphasis on student participation.  Students will be responsible for three areas of activity: </H3>
<H3>1) Participation, 2) Reaction Papers, and 3) Discussion Leading.  </H3>
<H3>1) PARTICIPATION includes class discussion of the assigned readings and weekly Web postings at the Threaded Discussion Area arranged for the seminar. </H3>
<H3>2) 	REACTION PAPERS are 1-2 TYPED PAGES in length and are based on the reading for
that week.  These twelve (12) papers should be a critical analysis/reflection on the texts. The papers will be evaluated on a “+/CHECK/-“ scale.  “-“ is missing or deficient (D-F). “CHECK” is an adequate summary with little or no analysis (B-C). “+” is a thoughtful, critical analysis (A). </H3>
<H3>3) 	DISCUSSION LEADING consists of forming a group of 2 students (by WEEK #3), 
selecting a topic/week and leading class discussion during that week.  Discussion leaders will be responsible for coming up with a set of discussion points or questions that correspond to the reading for that week.  These questions must be posted by NOON the Sunday before class.</H3>
